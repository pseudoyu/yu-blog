The most delightful experience this week was trying out Follow, an application that excited me after a long while. I compared it with Readwise and decided to cancel my subscription. I also implemented a self-hosted Web Archive solution, and it felt great to eat my own dog food. I continued working on the wall mural with my senior, and there were many other interesting happenings.</description></item><item><title>Weekly Review #66 - 10x Engineers, Technical Passion and Personal Toolkit</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/de/2024/07/30/weekly_review_20240730/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jul 2024 20:30:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/de/2024/07/30/weekly_review_20240730/</guid><description>&amp;#39;Photograph - Ed Sheeran&amp;#39; Preface This piece records and reflects on my life from 2024-07-22 to 2024-07-30.
After an exceptionally rich Adventure X week of activities, I&amp;rsquo;ve returned to the daily routine of coding with focused attention. I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy with work requirements; continuing to develop the API portion of EpubKit using Cloudflare Worker; refactoring the backend of a side project I started over a year ago but never fully realized using Go, and beginning to attempt writing an API server in Rust; created an Astro web project &amp;ldquo;tools.</description></item><item><title>Weekly Review #65 - Adventure X Experience, Apple Notes Practice, and EpubKit</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/de/2024/07/21/weekly_review_20240721/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Jul 2024 08:30:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/de/2024/07/21/weekly_review_20240721/</guid><description>&amp;#39;Photograph - Ed Sheeran&amp;#39; Preface This piece records and reflects on my life from July 10 to July 21, 2024.
This week and a half has been quite eventful. Work has been somewhat busy. I participated in the Adventure X event, which was a lot of fun. I experimented with the Remix framework and prepared for a workshop. I met with Randy, and together we planned the redesign and subsequent development of EpubKit, essentially holding our own hackathon for us &amp;ldquo;middle-aged hippies&amp;rdquo; who couldn&amp;rsquo;t participate in the competition.</description></item><item><title>Weekly Review #64 - Life Is Here (Stoner and Normal People)</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/de/2024/07/10/weekly_review_20240710/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jul 2024 08:30:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/de/2024/07/10/weekly_review_20240710/</guid><description>&amp;#39;Photograph - Ed Sheeran&amp;#39; Preface This piece is a reflection on life from July 1st to July 9th, 2024.
This week, I maintained an early rising routine for several days, dedicating time to reading and studying with high efficiency. However, establishing a regular pattern still requires time and adjustment. I&amp;rsquo;m also exploring how to enter and switch work modes more swiftly. I&amp;rsquo;m simultaneously reading several books: &amp;ldquo;Atlas Shrugged&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Normal People&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;What My Bones Know&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>Geständnis mit 27: Erwachsenwerden ist eine entmutigende Angelegenheit</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/de/2024/06/06/yearly_review_27/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jun 2024 19:42:26 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/de/2024/06/06/yearly_review_27/</guid><description>《Reply 1988 OST》 Vorwort Es ist der 6.

Die Idee für den wöchentlichen Rückblick entstand an meinem Geburtstag vor zwei Jahren. Wie ich in der Zusammenfassung des letzten Jahres erwähnte, ist dies eine Kolumne und ein Ritual, das ich beibehalten möchte, und es ist wie versprochen eingetroffen.
Im ersten Jahr schrieb ich 40 wöchentliche Rückblicke, aber letztes Jahr waren es nur 20.</description></item><item><title>Weekly Review #54 - Drifting Plan, Stolen Wallet, and Home Server</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/de/2024/03/16/weekly_review_20240316/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Mar 2024 05:20:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/de/2024/03/16/weekly_review_20240316/</guid><description>&amp;#39;Photograph - Ed Sheeran&amp;#39; Preface This piece is a record and reflection of my life from 2024-03-01 to 2024-03-16.
As mentioned in the previous weekly review, I embarked on a drifting plan, which concluded with a nearly two-week journey through &amp;ldquo;Hangzhou -&amp;gt; Shanghai -&amp;gt; Huzhou -&amp;gt; Nanjing -&amp;gt; Beijing&amp;rdquo;. Mostly confined to Jiangsu and Zhejiang, there weren&amp;rsquo;t any extraordinary landscapes; it was more about people and events. Due to my main wallet being stolen without determining the cause, I reinstalled two primary computers, which provided an opportunity to reorganize my development environment configuration.</description></item><item><title>Weekly Review #53 - Three Blank Months, Life Adrift, and Spring Festival</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/de/2024/02/29/weekly_review_20240229/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Feb 2024 19:13:26 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/de/2024/02/29/weekly_review_20240229/</guid><description>&amp;#39;Special Person - Khalil Fong&amp;#39; Preface This piece is a record and reflection of my life from December 4, 2023, to February 29, 2024.

This week had quite a bit of discussion and development at work, maintaining a normal rhythm. My days were largely occupied by work, study, and additional reading, giving me a sense of fulfillment.

This week, I returned to a normal rhythm. Work-wise, the main task was discussing and designing solutions, without much coding involved. For another AI-related project, I wrote some backend API code related to smart contracts and call chains. Although I&amp;rsquo;ve written quite a few contracts, opportunities for non-demo projects that string together the entire process are still rare.</description></item><item><title>Weekly Review #48 - Inner Mongolia Trip, Chiang Mai Digital Nomads, Restarting Weekly Reviews and Life</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/de/2023/11/07/weekly_review_20231107/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Nov 2023 17:01:36 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/de/2023/11/07/weekly_review_20231107/</guid><description>&amp;#39;Tenderness - Mayday&amp;#39; Preface This piece is a record and reflection on my life from 2023-09-17 to 2023-11-07.

On Monday, I went to see the long-awaited &amp;ldquo;Oppenheimer&amp;rdquo; - it had been a while since I last went to the cinema. Saturday was spent sketching at the Old Summer Palace, a fully immersive day. Sunday marked my first boxing class at a boxing gym, quite a novel experience.</description></item><item><title>Weekly Review #41 - Birthday Rituals, Time Management, and a Trip to Beijing</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/de/2023/06/12/weekly_review_20230612/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jun 2023 09:50:09 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/de/2023/06/12/weekly_review_20230612/</guid><description>&amp;#39;Here After Us - Mayday&amp;#39; Preface This is a record and reflection of my life from May 30, 2023 to June 12, 2023.

It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until the weekend that I realized I hadn&amp;rsquo;t gone downstairs at all this week, which seems to have become the norm in my life. However, my efficiency was decent.

As I type this first line, I realize it has been delayed for three weeks. Many interesting things happened during this period, but it seems my desire to share has been gradually fading. I only jotted down some fragmented thoughts in Logseq, and despite several attempts to organize them, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find the right approach.</description></item><item><title>Weekly Review #38 - Foundry Contract Testing, Logseq Task Management, and Surge Ponte Remote Development</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/de/2023/04/30/weekly_review_20230430/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Apr 2023 00:10:03 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/de/2023/04/30/weekly_review_20230430/</guid><description>&amp;#39;Here After Us - Mayday&amp;#39; Preface This piece is a record and reflection of my life from 2023-04-19 to 2023-04-30.
In my previous weekly review, I mentioned a journey across multiple cities. After returning to Hangzhou, I gradually resumed my original life rhythm. I had much more time alone, with plenty of input, reflection, and interesting things to do. However, it seems that I had less time to organize and dialogue with myself, often only realizing the passage of time several days later.</description></item><item><title>Weekly Review #37 - A Fortnight of Leisure (Wuhan | Hong Kong | Mayday)</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/de/2023/04/18/weekly_review_20230418/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Apr 2023 11:39:21 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/de/2023/04/18/weekly_review_20230418/</guid><description>&amp;#39;Here After Us - Mayday&amp;#39; Preface This piece chronicles my life and reflections from April 3rd to April 18th, 2023.
Perhaps due to my recent change in lifestyle, I had planned numerous engagements as early as March. From the beginning of April, I found myself wandering, experiencing a fortnight of leisure. This journey was akin to a homecoming - departing from Hangzhou where I was raised, to Wuhan, the first place I left home for an extended period, to visit my professor and old friends, and finally to Hong Kong, where I spent some remarkable years, to attend exhibitions and events.</description></item><item><title>Weekly Review #36 - Gastroenteritis, Nini's Update, and New Journeys</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/de/2023/04/02/weekly_review_20230402/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Apr 2023 12:01:26 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/de/2023/04/02/weekly_review_20230402/</guid><description>&amp;#39;Don&amp;#39;t Stop the Clocks - King Gnu&amp;#39; Preface This piece is a record and reflection of my life from 2023-03-25 to 2023-04-02.
Never did I imagine that as a southerner who lived in Hangzhou for over a decade, I would suffer severe adaptation issues upon returning to live in Hangzhou.
In the previous post, I mentioned that Nini was a bit sick due to the bumpy journey and other factors.</description></item><item><title>Weekly Review #35 - Newspaper Feature, Moving, and a Sick Nini</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/de/2023/03/24/weekly_review_20230324/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Mar 2023 11:21:15 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/de/2023/03/24/weekly_review_20230324/</guid><description>&amp;#39;Don&amp;#39;t Stop the Clocks - King Gnu&amp;#39; Preface This piece is a record and reflection of my life from 2023-03-14 to 2023-03-23.
If it weren&amp;rsquo;t for xLog&amp;rsquo;s incentive, I might have skipped this weekly review.
In the past week or so, a series of events unfolded: Nini fell ill, my parents drove to Beijing to pick up the cat (and me), I accompanied them sightseeing (though it was my first time at all the attractions too), met with friends before parting ways, endured a 15-hour cross-city journey, found a new apartment (though it only took an hour to sign the lease), moved and decorated the new place, and started a new job.</description></item><item><title>Weekly Review #34 - Don't Stop the Clocks</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/de/2023/03/13/weekly_review_20230313/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Mar 2023 17:29:49 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/de/2023/03/13/weekly_review_20230313/</guid><description>&amp;#39;Don&amp;#39;t Stop the Clocks - King Gnu&amp;#39; Preface This piece is a record and reflection of my life from 2023-03-08 to 2023-03-13.

Unconsciously, this is already the 24th article, and the last weekly report of 2022. Sometimes there&amp;rsquo;s this inexplicable sense of ceremony when meaningful events occur at rather round time points, which often makes one particularly happy.
Sometimes the desire to share is just so wondrous.</description></item><item><title>Weekly Review #23 - How to Learn a New Technology (A Liberal Arts Major's Perspective on Coding)</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/de/2022/12/19/weekly_review_20221219/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Dec 2022 06:20:46 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/de/2022/12/19/weekly_review_20221219/</guid><description>&amp;#39;Brand New Day - Theme song from Flying Colors&amp;#39; Preface This is a record and reflection of my life from December 14 to December 19, 2022.

It&amp;rsquo;s been about 20 cumulative days since I last stepped out of my home. Given the current workload of multiple concurrent projects and the almost-cleared negative status, I haven&amp;rsquo;t planned to return to the office yet. I&amp;rsquo;m even considering staying at home until before the new year.

They say it takes 21 days to form a habit, yet by the 21st weekly review, I still haven&amp;rsquo;t managed to update on schedule. Each week brings a creative excuse for the delay.

The weekend has arrived, and for once, I had no concentrated development work. I slept soundly, caught up on some missed episodes in the afternoon, and finally began writing my weekly review.

I almost missed this week&amp;rsquo;s review. It&amp;rsquo;s been a long time since I published on time on Sundays (and it&amp;rsquo;s getting later and later).

This week marked the first week of living with my cat. Due to the Double 11 shopping festival, I bought many cat facilities and food. With numerous deliveries arriving, I spent about half of my time working from home and receiving packages, which allowed for more bonding time.

As the previous weekly review was updated quite late, this period seems particularly brief in its time span. However, it holds special significance due to a major change that entered my life.
After a three-day journey to cat shelters from Friday to Sunday, filled with indecision, I brought home a silver point (silver shaded colorpoint?</description></item><item><title>Weekly Review #16 - Pure Learning</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/de/2022/10/27/weekly_review_20221027/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Oct 2022 00:28:15 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/de/2022/10/27/weekly_review_20221027/</guid><description>&amp;#39;Here After Us - Mayday&amp;#39; Preface This piece is a record and reflection of my life from October 19 to October 27, 2022.
This week has been busy with work projects, with several consecutive days of overtime, but I&amp;rsquo;ve finally completed my part of the requirements. However, during the spare moments, I managed to go through introductory tutorials for several languages I&amp;rsquo;ve long wanted to learn, which was quite interesting.</description></item><item><title>Weekly Review #15 - Introspection and External Seeking</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/de/2022/10/18/weekly_review_20221018/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Oct 2022 17:38:39 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/de/2022/10/18/weekly_review_20221018/</guid><description>&amp;#39;Here After Us - Mayday&amp;#39; Preface This is a record and reflection of my life from October 10, 2022 to October 18, 2022.
Due to the pandemic, I had been staying at home in Hangzhou. As the weather turned cooler and I hadn&amp;rsquo;t brought many clothes, I bought a ticket back to Beijing as soon as my health code turned green. I returned to Beijing on Friday. In just half a month, my home had become quite messy, so I spent almost the entire weekend cleaning and organizing.</description></item><item><title>Weekly Review #14 - Suspended Life and Self</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/de/2022/10/09/weekly_review_20221009/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Oct 2022 09:51:31 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/de/2022/10/09/weekly_review_20221009/</guid><description>&amp;#39;Here After Us - Mayday&amp;#39; Preface This piece is a record and reflection of my life from September 27, 2022 to October 9, 2022.
This is a weekly review spanning quite a long period. The reason being that I took leave early on the morning of September 29 and returned to Hangzhou, followed by the National Day holiday, making it a small extended vacation. That week was mainly occupied with overtime work and the journey home, so I decided to merge it into one article.</description></item><item><title>Weekly Review #13 - The Joy of Stealing Time from a Busy Schedule</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/de/2022/09/26/weekly_review_20220926/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Sep 2022 23:19:25 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/de/2022/09/26/weekly_review_20220926/</guid><description>&amp;#39;Here After Us - Mayday&amp;#39; Preface This piece is a record and reflection of my life from 2022-09-19 to 2022-09-26.
This week was unusually busy, with several days where I returned home quite late. Yet, strangely, it&amp;rsquo;s during such times that I seem to find more motivation to do more. I finished a book, caught up on many movies and TV series, and accomplished numerous tasks, both big and small.</description></item><item><title>Weekly Review #12 - Cyberspace, Self-Definition and Boundaries</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/de/2022/09/19/weekly_review_20220919/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Sep 2022 12:53:53 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/de/2022/09/19/weekly_review_20220919/</guid><description>&amp;#39;Here After Us - Mayday&amp;#39; Preface This is a record and reflection of my life from 2022-09-13 to 2022-09-18.
The past week has been somewhat busy, oscillating between several projects, so I haven&amp;rsquo;t had much input. I had to work over the weekend but didn&amp;rsquo;t want to stay cooped up at home, so I went out and unexpectedly found a nice café where I spent a pleasant day.
Cyberspace I previously learned about the concept of &amp;ldquo;cyberspace&amp;rdquo; from Reorx&amp;rsquo;s article &amp;ldquo;Using Automated Workflows to Aggregate Information Intake and Output&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>Weekly Review #11 - Moods, Travels and Serendipities</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/de/2022/09/13/weekly_review_20220913/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Sep 2022 12:53:53 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/de/2022/09/13/weekly_review_20220913/</guid><description>&amp;#39;Here After Us - Mayday&amp;#39; Preface This piece is a record and reflection of my life from September 5, 2022 to September 12, 2022.
The past week was quite enriching, both during the workdays and the Mid-Autumn Festival holiday. Work gradually became busier but also more interesting; daily life saw some changes, no longer so dull and mundane; I&amp;rsquo;ve grown accustomed to pulling out my Kindle for a few pages even during short car rides of just a few dozen minutes, quickly becoming immersed; going out has become more frequent, even if it&amp;rsquo;s just aimlessly walking the streets.</description></item><item><title>Docker Grundlagen und Praktiken</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/de/2022/09/07/container_docker_basic/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Sep 2022 01:30:48 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/de/2022/09/07/container_docker_basic/</guid><description>《后来的我们 - 五月天》 Vorwort Dies ist der erste Artikel im Container-Abschnitt der Arbeitspraxis-Serie, der hauptsächlich die Grundlagen und Praktiken von Docker vorstellt.

I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered that I&amp;rsquo;ve accumulated many unedited original photos from the past. I&amp;rsquo;m slowly organizing them now. Currently, I&amp;rsquo;m selecting a work that fits the theme as much as possible for each cover image. I&amp;rsquo;ll see if I can select some as specific themed portfolios later.
I&amp;rsquo;m quite surprised to hear from several friends in real life that they&amp;rsquo;re following my weekly reviews.</description></item><item><title>Weekly Review #09 - Colorless Yu and His Year of Pilgrimage</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/de/2022/08/29/weekly_review_20220829/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Aug 2022 11:08:14 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/de/2022/08/29/weekly_review_20220829/</guid><description>&amp;#39;Here After Us - Mayday&amp;#39; Preface This is a record and reflection of my life from August 22, 2022 to August 28, 2022.
This week, there were finally some changes at work. I entered another project that I&amp;rsquo;m very interested in and more challenging. I feel I can put to use some of the contract and underlying chain-related knowledge I learned while working from home. A colleague I was quite close to left the company mid-week.</description></item><item><title>Weekly Review #05 - Work, Sense of Time Control, and New Friends</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/de/2022/07/31/weekly_review_20220731/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Jul 2022 23:55:54 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/de/2022/07/31/weekly_review_20220731/</guid><description>&amp;#39;Here After Us - Mayday&amp;#39; Preface This piece is a record and reflection of my life from July 25, 2022, to July 31, 2022, also the first week back to work after a vacation.
After experiencing a rare &amp;ldquo;short summer break,&amp;rdquo; I was immediately thrust into the tense preparation of a new project before I had time to adjust my state, which also prompted me to think more about the balance between work and life.</description></item><item><title>Weekly Review #03 - Health, Goals and the Rhythm of Life</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/de/2022/07/11/weekly_review_20220711/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Jul 2022 08:30:20 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/de/2022/07/11/weekly_review_20220711/</guid><description>&amp;#39;Here After Us - Mayday&amp;#39; Preface It seems that every time I start with the title, I try to set a theme for the past week.

Perhaps this way, life will be like a series of chapters pieced together, and when looking back after a long time, it will feel like a fulfilling book.

I&amp;rsquo;ve always been a person with an inexplicable sense of ritual. At this juncture, I frequently reflect on my thoughts, gains, anxieties, and regrets from this past year. I often wonder, on this day a year ago, what would that nervous yet expectant version of myself have hoped to gain from the year ahead?</description></item><item><title>Warum ich 2022 immer noch blogge</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/de/2022/06/12/why_i_still_write_blog_in_2022/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jun 2022 13:48:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/de/2022/06/12/why_i_still_write_blog_in_2022/</guid><description>&amp;#39;Here After Us - Mayday&amp;#39; Vorwort Kürzlich habe ich mehrere Artikel veröffentlicht, in denen ich meinen Blog-Einrichtungsprozess und dessen Komponenten vorgestellt habe.

Es gibt oft den Scherz, dass die tägliche Arbeit immer um CRUD-Operationen kreist. Die Beherrschung der Verwendung gängiger relationaler Datenbanken ist eine grundlegende Fähigkeit für Entwickler. Dieser Artikel bietet einen Überblick über die grundlegenden Kenntnisse und zugehörigen Operationen von MySQL, einer beliebten relationalen Datenbank, auf dem MacOS-System zur einfachen Referenz.
Überblick über Daten und Datenbanken Daten Grundsätzlich sind Daten eine Art von Fakten oder beobachteten Ergebnissen, eine logische Zusammenfassung objektiver Sachverhalte und eine Form und ein Träger von Informationen.</description></item></channel></rss>
