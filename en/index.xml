<p>In my article &ldquo;<a href="https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2024/06/29/what_changed_in_my_blog_2024/">What Changed in My Blog in 2024</a>&rdquo;, I introduced the blog system I built using Serverless platforms and some open-source projects. I also started this series of tutorials to document the entire process of setup and deployment.</p>
<p>This article focuses on the analytics system solution.</p>
<h2 id="analytics-system-solution">Analytics System Solution</h2>
<p>Compared to the blog itself and the commenting system, I hadn&rsquo;t paid much attention to an analytics system for a long time (<del>mainly because there weren&rsquo;t many readers back then</del>). I hadn&rsquo;t considered much about SEO or other promotional aspects. However, I gradually discovered that the data collected is not just a pretty chart to post on Twitter; it has great reference value for blog topic selection and content.</p>
<p>In fact, mainstream mature solutions can meet basic needs. Even the free Google Analytics is more than enough. However, during the development of my blog, I still went through several iterations for various reasons, and finally settled on GoatCounter as my solution.</p>
<h3 id="splitbee">splitbee</h3>
<p>Initially, I used a free tool called splitbee. It provided free basic analytics quota, had a nice interface, and supported complex user tracking, A/B testing, etc. But as I recall, it only retained data for half a year, and required an upgrade after exceeding 5000 page views per month, so I abandoned it later.</p>
<h3 id="cloudflare--google-search-console">Cloudflare + Google Search Console</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/cloudflare_web_stats.png" alt="cloudflare_web_stats"></p>
<p>After abandoning splitbee, for a long time, I didn&rsquo;t integrate any additional analytics applications. Instead, I used Cloudflare&rsquo;s built-in site statistics. However, I found that it only tracked total network traffic, including a lot of ineffective data such as crawlers, and lacked details down to the path level.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/google_search_console.png" alt="google_search_console"></p>
<p>Later, after learning about the concept of SEO, I added <a href="https://search.google.com/search-console/about">Google Search Console</a> as another analytics dimension. This is currently the data I find most meaningful for my blog writing. It mainly presents the keywords users use to reach my blog site in search engines and the page paths they click through from search results to enter my blog.</p>
<p>As you can see, an article titled &ldquo;<a href="https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/category/tools/">Warp, iTerm2, or Alacritty? My Terminal Tinkering Notes</a>&rdquo; brought me many visitors, while topics about blog setup and smart contract development are also the first impressions of my blog for most natural users coming from search engines.</p>
<h3 id="umami--supabase--netlify">Umami + Supabase + Netlify</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/yu_umami_record.png" alt="yu_umami_record"></p>
<p>However, the above two methods still only show overall website data. To precisely track the performance of a specific article over a period or real-time access data after an article is published, an analytics system is still needed. After reading Reorx&rsquo;s article &ldquo;<a href="https://reorx.com/blog/deploy-umami-for-personal-website/">Deploy umami to collect personal website statistics | Reorx&rsquo;s Forge</a>&rdquo;, I chose to use umami, an open-source, easily self-deployable analytics system. It has a clean interface, user-friendly features, and is easy to integrate into one&rsquo;s own blog system.</p>
<p>I used it for a year and a half without any problems. However, possibly because I started using it quite early, during a major version update, there was an incompatible field update in the database migration script. I found it a bit hard to understand why such a level of open-source project would have this kind of issue. I also saw many other users with the same concerns in the issues, but ultimately no good solution was provided.</p>
<p>But the biggest problem was that an analytics system relied on two platforms, which was too heavy in terms of deployment and maintenance. When either the database or Netlify encountered problems or needed migration, it would bring many additional costs. So when I updated my blog&rsquo;s commenting system recently, I thought I might as well switch to the lighter GoatCounter.</p>
<h3 id="goatcounter--zeabur">GoatCounter + Zeabur</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/goatcounter_stats.png" alt="goatcounter_stats"></p>
<p>I stumbled upon this niche analytics system while checking Reorx&rsquo;s blog code updates. I was immediately attracted by its Retro Internet style. It has almost no superfluous buttons, yet the functionality is very complete. Moreover, it uses a go single binary file + sqlite single file database architecture, which is lightweight and easy to deploy. So I decided to migrate.</p>
<p>Actually, my own GoatCounter is deployed on <a href="https://fly.io/">fly.io</a>, but I&rsquo;ve already explained the operation instructions for fly in great detail in my previous article about Remark42. I didn&rsquo;t want to repeat too much. Coincidentally, I&rsquo;ve been heavily using <a href="https://zeabur.com?referralCode=pseudoyu">Zeabur</a>, a Serverless platform, recently. So this article will use <a href="https://zeabur.com?referralCode=pseudoyu">Zeabur</a> as an example, though the method is equally applicable to other similar platforms.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also provided configuration files for fly.io deployment and docker-compose deployment on VPS after the Zeabur deployment solution for reference.</p>
<h2 id="goatcounter-deployment-instructions">GoatCounter Deployment Instructions</h2>
<p>GoatCounter&rsquo;s code itself is open-source - &ldquo;<a href="https://github.com/arp242/goatcounter">GitHub - arp242/goatcounter</a>&rdquo;, with clear and easy-to-read documentation. You can configure it according to your actual needs. The GoatCounter + Zeabur solution only involves a single service, with the database using sqlite mounted in a volume, so the deployment is very simple.</p>
<h3 id="deploying-with-zeabur">Deploying with Zeabur</h3>
<p><a href="https://zeabur.com?referralCode=pseudoyu">Zeabur</a> requires a Developer Plan for container application deployment, which costs $5/month. However, for image services like this, the overall usage and cost are relatively low, and the monthly quota is sufficient to deploy many services. You can choose according to your needs. The overall deployment process is much simpler compared to fly.io. All operations can be completed using the web interface, without the need to install additional command-line tools.</p>
<h4 id="register-on-zeabur">Register on zeabur</h4>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/zeabur_login.png" alt="zeabur_login"></p>
<p>Visit the <a href="https://zeabur.com?referralCode=pseudoyu">Zeabur</a> official website and click on the top right corner to log in with your GitHub account authorization.</p>
<h4 id="create-a-new-project">Create a New Project</h4>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/zeabur_new_project.png" alt="zeabur_new_project"></p>
<p>After entering the main interface, click the <code>Create Project</code> button in the top right corner.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/zeabur_hk_region.png" alt="zeabur_hk_region"></p>
<p>I chose the AWS data center in Hong Kong. Different data centers have some differences in access speed, performance, and price. You can choose according to your needs.</p>
<h4 id="configure-image-deployment">Configure Image Deployment</h4>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/zeabur_build.png" alt="zeabur_build"></p>
<p>In the next step, choose to deploy using a Docker container image.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/zeabur_docker_custom_config.png" alt="zeabur_docker_custom_config"></p>
<p>Since we&rsquo;re using a self-built image and there&rsquo;s no official GoatCounter template, we click to choose custom.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/zeabur_prebuilt_edit_toml.png" alt="zeabur_prebuilt_edit_toml"></p>
<p>At this step, you can fill in various configuration items on the interface yourself, but perhaps because I&rsquo;m used to fly.io&rsquo;s file configuration mode, I chose to <code>Edit TOML file</code> in the bottom left corner. You can also directly copy my configuration file and modify it.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/zeabur_prebuilt_goatcounter_toml.png" alt="zeabur_prebuilt_goatcounter_toml"></p>
<p>After configuration, click the deploy button in the bottom right corner.</p>
<h4 id="deployment-complete">Deployment Complete</h4>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/yu-goatcounter_project.png" alt="yu-goatcounter_project"></p>
<p>After clicking deploy, wait for a moment, and there will be a generated default project name. You can modify it to a more readable name, such as <code>yu-goatcounter</code>, in the settings in the upper left corner.</p>
<h4 id="configure-custom-domain">Configure Custom Domain</h4>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/zeabur_create_domain.png" alt="zeabur_create_domain"></p>
<p>After the service is deployed, we need to bind a domain to access the website through the public network. Zeabur provides free second-level domains like <code>xx.zeabur.app</code>, or you can bind your own domain.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/zeabur_custom_domain.png" alt="zeabur_custom_domain"></p>
<p>The generated domain can be used directly without any other configuration, such as <code>goatcounter.zeabur.app</code>. If you&rsquo;re using a custom domain, you need to add a CNAME record in your domain management backend, pointing to a data center address in the format of <code>xxx.cname.zeabur-dns.com</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/cloudflare_goatcounter_config.png" alt="cloudflare_goatcounter_config"></p>
<p>For example, my domain is hosted on Cloudflare, and the added CNAME record is as shown in the above image. I asked the official support, and they said if you choose the AWS HK data center, you can use Cloudflare&rsquo;s proxy, which theoretically would be faster. You can configure according to your needs.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you choose the Huawei Cloud data center, you need to file for domain registration and add an extra TXT record. You can follow the prompts to operate.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/zeabur_custom_domain_success.png" alt="zeabur_custom_domain_success"></p>
<p>A green display indicates successful configuration. At this point, our GoatCounter service deployment is complete.</p>
<h4 id="data-backup">Data Backup</h4>
<p>We had this section in our configuration:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-toml" data-lang="toml"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">[[</span><span class="nx">volumes</span><span class="p">]]</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nx">id</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="s2">&#34;goatcounter-data&#34;</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nx">dir</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="s2">&#34;/data&#34;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This function mounts the <code>/data</code> directory inside the container (where our sqlite database is located) to a storage volume with the id <code>goatcounter-data</code>. If you don&rsquo;t mount a storage volume, data will be lost when the container restarts or redeploys.</p>
<p>Regarding this storage volume point, Zeabur&rsquo;s interface doesn&rsquo;t have a very intuitive display and management operation, to the extent that I always doubt whether my configuration is effective.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/zeabur_add_goatcounter_backup.png" alt="zeabur_add_goatcounter_backup"></p>
<p>After researching for a while, I found that you can first pause the service in the settings, then add a new backup in the backup module above. After clicking download, you can see our backup file locally, with the directory hierarchy as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-plaintext" data-lang="plaintext"><span class="line"><span class="cl">data/
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">└── goatcounter-data
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    └── goatcounter.sqlite3
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This indicates that our data has been successfully persisted. I hope Zeabur can have a more intuitive display on the interface.</p>
<h3 id="deploying-with-flyio">Deploying with fly.io</h3>
<p>For a purely free solution, you can still refer to the article I mentioned &ldquo;<a href="https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2024/07/22/free_commenting_system_using_remark42_and_flyio/">Build Your Free Blog Comment System from Scratch (Remark42 + fly.io)</a>&rdquo;. Only the <code>fly.toml</code> configuration part is different. I&rsquo;ve also provided the configuration file I use - &ldquo;<a href="https://github.com/pseudoyu/goatcounter-on-fly/blob/master/fly.toml">fly.toml</a>&rdquo; for reference.</p>
<h3 id="deploying-with-docker-and-docker-compose">Deploying with Docker and docker-compose</h3>
<p>Interestingly, because the author of goatcounter is very persistent and feels that containerizing such a single-file application would actually increase maintenance costs, no official image is provided. However, having an image is still convenient for deploying on your own VPS or serverless platform. So I used Github Actions to create a CI for building images and uploading to Docker Hub. You can use it if needed. The corresponding Dockerfile and Docker Compose file can also be referenced from this <a href="https://github.com/pseudoyu/goatcounter/commit/b98de9873ee331133a39b409fd4bb00cf55c8a05">Commit</a>, or you can directly use <code>pseudoyu/goatcounter</code> and the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file.</p>

<p>In the above section, we completed the deployment of the GoatCounter service. Now we can access our analytics system service through the generated/custom domain. For example, I access it through <code>https://goatcounter.pseudoyu.com</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/goatcounter_create_user.png" alt="goatcounter_create_user"></p>
<p>The first login requires creating a user. Fill in the email and password, then click <code>Create</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/goatcounter_dashboard_success.png" alt="goatcounter_dashboard_success"></p>
<p>After successful login, there&rsquo;s no data yet, and a script will be prompted, which we&rsquo;ll use in our blog configuration later.</p>
<h2 id="configuring-goatcounter-for-the-blog">Configuring GoatCounter for the Blog</h2>
<p>Following the above, we&rsquo;ve completed the deployment and basic configuration of the GoatCounter service. Now we need to add the analytics component to our blog posts. Taking my Hugo blog as an example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">script</span> <span class="na">data-goatcounter</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&#34;https://goatcounter.pseudoyu.com/count&#34;</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">        <span class="na">async</span> <span class="na">src</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&#34;//goatcounter.pseudoyu.com/count.js&#34;</span><span class="p">&gt;&lt;/</span><span class="nt">script</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/add_goatcounter_script_in_hugo.png" alt="add_goatcounter_script_in_hugo"></p>
<p>Add the above code to the <code>head</code> of my Hugo theme. For example, in my Hugo theme, it&rsquo;s in the <code>layouts/partials/head.html</code> file. Different themes or different SSG frameworks might have slightly different locations, but they&rsquo;re broadly similar.</p>
<p>One thing to note is that goatcounter ignores requests from <code>localhost</code> to avoid too much dirty data during local preview. Therefore, you won&rsquo;t see data when debugging locally; you need to deploy the webpage to see access data.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/final_display_of_goatcounter.png" alt="final_display_of_goatcounter"></p>
<p>The effect after collecting data is roughly as shown in the above image. You can also set some configuration items, add new pages, view detailed data, etc., in the GoatCounter interface. This includes displaying the visit count for each page. You can explore according to the documentation.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>At this point, our blog analytics system is set up! This article is part of my blog setup and deployment tutorial series. The main body of the blog theme is complete, with only some details like in-blog search remaining for experience optimization. I hope this can be of reference to everyone.</p>

<p>This piece is a record and reflection of my life from <code>2024-07-31</code> to <code>2024-08-04</code>.</p>
<p>The most delightful experience this week was trying out Follow, an application that excited me after a long while. I compared it with Readwise and decided to cancel my subscription. I also implemented a self-hosted Web Archive solution, and it felt great to eat my own dog food. I continued working on the wall mural with my senior, and there were many other interesting happenings.</p>
<h2 id="reshaping-my-information-input-system-with-follow">Reshaping My Information Input System with Follow</h2>
<h3 id="my-information-input-system">My Information Input System</h3>
<p>Long ago, I was a heavy information dependant. Whenever I came across good blogs or news sites, I would quickly add them to my RSS feed sources, grinning at the neatly categorized and tagged list. When I found good newsletters, I would immediately subscribe with my email. The first thing I did every morning was to clear the unread items in Reeder 4, which I was using at the time, and then browse through the newsletter emails one by one.</p>
<p>Initially, it seemed fine. I felt satisfied that I could read all the news and articles I cared about as soon as they were available. But gradually, it became overwhelming. I spent more and more time on it every morning, even forcing myself to digest articles I wasn&rsquo;t interested in. Rather than acquiring information, it became more of a craving for information and a compensation for information anxiety. The effect was there, of course - the information left traces in my brain, but the efficiency of digestion was not high.</p>
<p>After reading the articles &ldquo;Using Automated Workflows to Aggregate Information Intake and Output&rdquo; and &ldquo;Saying No to Newsletters&rdquo;, I made significant adjustments.</p>
<p>In terms of information sources, I unsubscribed from all WeChat official accounts and newsletters, and reduced my RSS feed sources to about 50. Most of the remaining input came from Twitter and other people&rsquo;s Telegram channels, which to some extent avoided information cocoons while keeping the input under control.</p>
<p>Moreover, by using n8n + telegram channel to build an automatic synchronization system for input and output sources, all my filtered information sources are automatically synced to my Telegram channel &ldquo;Yu&rsquo;s Life&rdquo;, making it convenient for me to view and review. It also serves as a personal sharing channel. The pressure of being public also reversely motivates me to filter information sources more carefully.</p>
<p>However, this solution still has two problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>It still hasn&rsquo;t solved the problem of my scattered information sources. I need to frequently switch between Twitter and various TG Channels, which is easy to distract and I might still miss some messages.</li>
<li>I often use the channel as my bookmark to some extent. Sometimes a lot of information is very personal, and as the number of followers of the channel grows, I also have some psychological pressure, worrying about becoming information noise for others.</li>
</ol>
<p>The emergence of Follow just fills in this gap in my solution.</p>
<h3 id="follow">Follow</h3>
<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Next generation information browser</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is Follow&rsquo;s slogan. Before its release, I merely regarded it as an alternative to RSS readers. Although I was familiar with RSSHub and heavily used my self-deployed instance, I still couldn&rsquo;t imagine how much room for development there could be based on this ancient protocol, until after its release and a few days of intensive use, I gradually understood this concept.</p>
<p>In the current era where RSS has already declined, apart from independent blogs, which are in a similar situation and almost all still retain complete RSS support, most news, information, and various niche websites no longer provide it. RSSHub is then the perfect and almost the only solution, which can convert web information sources including but not limited to Twitter, TG Channel, Bilibili, and NetEase Music playlists into standard RSS format, allowing these information sources to be updated like subscribing to articles.</p>
<p>However, RSSHub is still more of a middleware tool. Even with standardized RSS data, most readers can only process text display, and the handling of audio, video, and images basically stays at the level of treating them as a URL. Therefore, I mostly apply it in my n8n synchronization workflow as a notification, only retaining its title and link, still clicking the source link to jump to the corresponding webpage to view, which often feels a bit disjointed to use.</p>
<p>Follow&rsquo;s biggest feature is naturally the inheritance of RSSHub&rsquo;s &ldquo;everything can be RSS&rdquo; philosophy, providing presentation methods for various forms of content such as videos, pictures, blog audio, articles, social media, etc. at the application layer. It really feels like a leap from pure HTML to modern CSS effects after looking at it for a long time. Actually, achieving this step is not a very high technical barrier. Whether it&rsquo;s video iFrame, audio player, or image preview, there are relatively mature components available for use. But Follow is almost the only product that is still focusing on and doing well with this protocol. Sometimes, doing a little better is enough.</p>
<h4 id="experience">Experience</h4>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/follow_homepage.png" alt="follow_homepage"></p>
<p>As an information browser/reader, the most intuitive and core aspects are the interface and interaction. The combination of DIYGod + Shiyier early on raised my expectations to the fullest, but even the first beta version still amazed me with its completeness and experience. Before this, the most modern one should be Reeder 4, and Follow, even though it&rsquo;s Electron and not pure native, still maintains an extremely exquisite design and interaction.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used multiple readers before, including NetNewsWire, Reeder 4, Miniflux, and Readwise Reader, but because the reading experience was often not as good as the original webpage, I mostly chose to jump to the link to view. However, Follow&rsquo;s pages and interactions themselves make me enjoy it. There&rsquo;s also an interesting recent reading history display, where you can see which visitors have read this article, and you can click into their homepage to see their subscriptions, combining social attributes and information source accumulation. I&rsquo;ve discovered many personal blogs that I hadn&rsquo;t paid attention to before through this method.</p>
<p>Moreover, due to Follow&rsquo;s deep integration with RSSHub, it can achieve direct subscription to social media by inputting twitter handle, Bilibili uid, and youtube channel name, without having to find the corresponding route in the documentation of the RSSHub website or set up your own instance, which is very user-friendly.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/follow_pic.png" alt="follow_pic"></p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/follow_video.png" alt="follow_video"></p>
<p>The direct display of videos and pictures is also a highlight. I&rsquo;ve seen a user using some designers&rsquo; Twitter as their source of design inspiration and aesthetic accumulation, which is also a very meaningful application scenario.</p>
<p>Audio/podcasts can be played globally in Follow. For example, in the bottom left corner of the previous screenshots, I was playing an episode of &ldquo;Beyond Code&rdquo; simultaneously. This also solves the problem of me having to repeatedly switch between multiple podcast apps like Apple Podcast, Spotify, and Xiaoyuzhou.</p>
<p>You can also conveniently share your subscriptions: <a href="https://web.follow.is/profile/pseudoyu">https://web.follow.is/profile/pseudoyu</a></p>
<p>There are actually quite a few more designs, such as the Action module and Power tipping, but this article is not a software review but a personal experience, so I won&rsquo;t elaborate too much. You can experience it yourself when it opens up later, keeping some surprises. Next, I want to talk about the comparison with Readwise Reader that I&rsquo;m currently using, and why I plan to switch to Follow.</p>
<h4 id="readwise-reader---follow">Readwise Reader -&gt; Follow</h4>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/readwise_sub.png" alt="readwise_sub"></p>
<p>I subscribed to Readwise Full membership around September last year. Although it offers a 50% discount for developing countries, it still costs nearly $50 a year. It&rsquo;s comprehensive, but the core functions I use are actually only three points:</p>
<ol>
<li>RSS reader</li>
<li>Read later, save articles and highlight annotations</li>
<li>Daily Digest</li>
</ol>
<p>Among them, the first point is the most frequent, as a convenient reader to manage my article subscriptions, etc. It also has a mobile app for reading anytime. However, during use, I found that sometimes the display style and image loading are not very good, and the classification and shortcuts are a bit too complex. It mainly supports articles, which can obviously be completely replaced by Follow (waiting for a mobile app).</p>
<p>I used to use highlight annotations quite often, using plugins to make some notes on some articles and save them to Readwise, then synchronize my articles to Telegram Channel through n8n. But it&rsquo;s actually a bit too dependent on the platform. When I really want to digest those highlighted notes and organize them into some formed ideas or articles, I need to go back to Readwise to view them. Even if I synchronize them to Logseq or Heptabase for organization, it&rsquo;s still not convenient. Especially now that I&rsquo;ve switched to Apple Notes as my main and only note-taking tool, I found that directly excerpting/recording some ideas is the most efficient and more likely to generate value. Therefore, the highlighting feature gradually faded out of my note-taking flow.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/save_website.jpg" alt="save_website"></p>
<p>As we all know, read later often evolves into never read later, so my current strategy is to almost never use read later, trying to read it right away as much as possible, with only a very few longer ones temporarily stored, and trying to clear the list on the same day. Now I use the unread mode as the default display in Follow, often browsing through it. When I come across an article that I&rsquo;m interested in and have read through, I use the star function to save it in my favorites. When I&rsquo;ve finished reading and gained something, I use a browser plugin I made + Cloudflare Worker api + n8n to save the article link and source HTML file to the D1 database, achieving Web Archive and automatically syncing to my Telegram Channel.</p>
<p>The third point, Daily Digest, helps me review some of my notes or articles. This is useful but not high-frequency. I haven&rsquo;t researched in detail whether the Follow Action module can do some operations on multiple articles.</p>
<p>Since my core needs can all be transferred to Follow, I decisively unsubscribed from Readwise. I can clearly feel that my information intake volume and quality have also significantly improved in these few days. A good software is actually not just an auxiliary tool, it has a more profound impact on thinking and habits.</p>

<h3 id="electron-bug">Electron Bug</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/talk_with_innei.jpg" alt="talk_with_innei"></p>
<p>I just discovered that there&rsquo;s an issue with the Follow client update. Clicking &ldquo;Click to restart&rdquo; hides the window instead of quitting it. It&rsquo;s a familiar bug, I wrote exactly the same one when I was writing EpubKit 🤣 I reported it to Shiyier, it&rsquo;s like exchanging Electron illness experiences.</p>
<h3 id="macos-desktop-decoration">macOS Desktop Decoration</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/macos_widgets.png" alt="macos_widgets"></p>
<p>This is my first attempt at macOS system desktop widgets. It&rsquo;s quite fresh, but I basically switch applications with Raycast shortcuts and hardly ever see the desktop&hellip;</p>

<p>My progress this week: painted five or six bricks 🤣</p>
<h2 id="interesting-things-and-objects">Interesting Things and Objects</h2>
<h3 id="input">Input</h3>
<p>Although most interesting inputs will be automatically synchronized in the &ldquo;Yu&rsquo;s Life&rdquo; Telegram channel, I still select a part to list here, feeling more like a newsletter. And I built a microblog - &ldquo;daily.pseudoyu.com&rdquo; using Telegram Channel messages as content source, which is more convenient to browse.</p>

<p>This piece records and reflects on my life from <code>2024-07-22</code> to <code>2024-07-30</code>.</p>
<p>After an exceptionally rich Adventure X week of activities, I&rsquo;ve returned to the daily routine of coding with focused attention. I&rsquo;ve been busy with work requirements; continuing to develop the API portion of EpubKit using Cloudflare Worker; refactoring the backend of a side project I started over a year ago but never fully realized using Go, and beginning to attempt writing an API server in Rust; created an Astro web project &ldquo;<a href="https://tools.pseudoyu.com/">tools.pseudoyu.com</a>&rdquo; for my personal toolkit project &ldquo;<a href="https://github.com/pseudoyu/yu-tools">GitHub - yu-tools</a>&rdquo;; wrote a tutorial blog on Remark42 deployment, which was validated by a reader in the process of setting up a blog system; went with my family to a water park in Thousand Island Lake, feeling like I&rsquo;m living quite a fulfilling life; tried watercolor painting and initiated a garage wall painting project; and many other interesting happenings.</p>
<h2 id="10x-engineers">10x Engineers</h2>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/randy_10x.png" alt="randy_10x"></p>
<p>Randy recently launched a project called &ldquo;<a href="https://askhackers.com/">Ask Hackers</a>&rdquo;, which is a search tool based on Hacker News Comments. It seems that from the inception of the idea to its launch and promotion, it only took about a day or two. This reminded me of the concept of a &ldquo;10x engineer&rdquo; - someone who can quickly develop and implement their ideas. I admire this ability.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve actually worked on quite a few projects, both professionally and personally, and I&rsquo;m embarrassed to say that while I&rsquo;ve touched on many tech stacks and can write a bit in each, I&rsquo;m not particularly deep in any of them. My ability to quickly implement and iterate on a product is still quite poor. There seems to be a missing link between idea and demo/product for me. I&rsquo;ve discussed this topic with Randy, and he thinks it&rsquo;s a matter of engineering experience. When he sees a certain effect on a website or app, he can generally guess how it&rsquo;s implemented and reproduce it, whereas I might still need to look at the source code or consult AI to barely manage it.</p>
<h2 id="technical-passion">Technical Passion</h2>
<p>Beyond this, I&rsquo;ve found that passion and motivation also influence my behavior. Perhaps because I still haven&rsquo;t found my own product idea and direction, I always feel that when I was doing side projects before, I was merely &ldquo;implementing&rdquo; or doing technical exercises. What attracted me wasn&rsquo;t the product itself taking shape, but the learning and improvement of technical skills in the implementation process. This is fine for personal growth, but for a product, it seems to lack soul. It&rsquo;s like when I first met Randy and curiously asked him why he wasn&rsquo;t updating Cusdis anymore, which had quite a few stars and many self-deployed users including myself. As I recall, he said that besides economic factors, it was more because he no longer had the motivation to do it, and couldn&rsquo;t muster more enthusiasm for a product he wouldn&rsquo;t use or pay for himself.</p>
<p>My own dilemma lies in this as well. It seems I still haven&rsquo;t found an idea that would excite me to the point of sleeplessness. On the contrary, when developing EpubKit together, as I&rsquo;ve been a long-time user of e-books myself, approaching from the perspective of a user, I have more ideas and enthusiasm for product iteration, and it feels more fulfilling.</p>
<p>One must be the first user of their own product.</p>
<h2 id="personal-toolkit-project">Personal Toolkit Project</h2>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/yu_tools_website.png" alt="yu_tools_website"></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been a heavy tinkerer of various software and hardware. I spend a large amount of time selecting the most suitable tool for almost every niche need I have, even if the time spent researching far exceeds the time using the tool itself. I still enjoy it immensely. From college until now, countless people around me have asked questions like &ldquo;Do you have any camera/keyboard/microphone/xxx recommendations?&rdquo; or &ldquo;I want to do xxx on my phone, are there any recommended apps?&rdquo; So over two years ago, I had the idea to create a personal toolkit list - &ldquo;<a href="https://github.com/pseudoyu/yu-tools">GitHub - yu-tools</a>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Initially, it was just a simple GitHub project with a <code>README.md</code> file. Later, I gradually added some categories and a brief description for each item. I updated it periodically over two years, and surprisingly, it became my most starred repo.</p>
<p>I had previously seen a toolkit website made by a developer I really like, &ldquo;<a href="https://www.craftz.dog/">devaslife/Takuya Matsuyama</a>&rdquo; - &ldquo;<a href="https://uses.craftz.dog/">A curated list of the tech I use</a>&rdquo;. He photographs each tool and adds his usage experience, which I found very valuable. So I spent an evening using Astro to create a website based on his template - &ldquo;<a href="https://tools.pseudoyu.com/">tools.pseudoyu.com</a>&rdquo;. It will focus more on software and services, and as the number of entries increases, I also want to add a conversational search function similar to &ldquo;<a href="https://askhackers.com/">Ask Hackers</a>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Photographing, screenshotting, and introducing software and hardware is a big project, and it&rsquo;s continuously being updated. Those who are interested can keep an eye on it.</p>
<h2 id="personal-life-snippets">Personal Life Snippets</h2>
<h3 id="watercolor">Watercolor</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/rust_painting.jpg" alt="rust_painting"></p>
<p>One time after dinner, my family tried painting watercolors on fans together. It was a completely new experience. I chose the Rust little crab, and with a bit of guidance from my senior, I completed this work. I&rsquo;m very happy!!!</p>
<h3 id="garage-wall-painting">Garage Wall Painting</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/wall_painting.jpg" alt="wall_painting"></p>
<p>Since generating the image I wanted to paint on the workshop wall using DALL-E, we finally found time to start work. Progress is at 30%, but due to a team meeting on Monday night, it was my senior and my sister who did the painting. Although I brought my camera, I didn&rsquo;t have time to record the complete process, which is a bit regrettable. Next time I&rsquo;ll take more photos of the process and details. Looking forward to the final effect.</p>
<h3 id="nini">Nini</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/nienie_on_desktop.jpg" alt="nienie_on_desktop"></p>
<p>Recently, perhaps sensing my busyness, both kittens have become more clingy. Every time I write code, Nini quietly lies on the desk, occasionally stretching lazily or making a coquettish sound, relaxing and healing.</p>
<h2 id="interesting-things-and-objects">Interesting Things and Objects</h2>
<h3 id="input">Input</h3>
<p>Although most interesting inputs are automatically synced to the &ldquo;<a href="https://t.me/pseudoyulife">Yu&rsquo;s Life</a>&rdquo; Telegram channel, I&rsquo;ll still select a few to list here. It feels more like a newsletter now.</p>

<p>In the article &ldquo;What Changed in My Blog in 2024&rdquo;, I introduced the blog system I built using Serverless platforms and some open-source projects, and also started this series of tutorials to document the entire process of building and deploying.</p>
<p>This article is about the solution for the commenting system.</p>
<h2 id="evolution-of-commenting-systems">Evolution of Commenting Systems</h2>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/remark42_comments.png" alt="remark42_comments"></p>
<p>I often feel that comments are not just communication between readers and authors, but the content itself is also part of the article. Sometimes the thoughts and discussions in comments can be more valuable than the article itself. Therefore, I have always placed great importance on the commenting system. I am unwilling to trust some third-party hosted services, do not want any censorship, and want the style to be as minimalist as possible and consistent with my blog style.</p>
<p>During the development of my blog, the commenting system solution has gone through several iterations. Regarding the types and choices of commenting systems, I very much like the developer <a href="https://reorx.com/">reorx</a>&rsquo;s detailed introduction in &ldquo;Changing Blog Commenting Systems&rdquo;. I won&rsquo;t elaborate further here; this article focuses more on personal experience and detailed setup process.</p>
<h3 id="disqus">Disqus</h3>
<p>The first blog commenting system I used was the notorious Disqus, a cumbersome and user privacy-collecting well-known commenting system. Because it loads slowly and the free version often comes with some ads, it was really unbearable. Plus, at that time, there were basically no comments, so there was no migration burden. I abandoned it after using it for a short time.</p>
<h3 id="utterances">Utterances</h3>
<p>So I switched to another commenting system based on GitHub issues called utterances. It generates an issue for each article, and users comment on the issue by authorizing GitHub login. The advantage of this method is that it only needs to authorize an utterances-bot for management, without the need to deploy services and maintain databases by yourself. However, after using it for a while, I felt there were several shortcomings:</p>
<ul>
<li>It relies on the GitHub API for comment management. If the interface changes later or restrictions are placed on this type of commenting method using issues, it would be unstable.</li>
<li>Readers must authorize GitHub login, which is very inconvenient for non-technical people or readers using mobile devices.</li>
<li>It pollutes the Issues record of the GitHub repository and is also inconvenient for subsequent migration to other systems.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cusdis--supabase--vercel">Cusdis + Supabase + Vercel</h3>
<p>Cusdis is an open-source commenting system focusing on data privacy made by <a href="https://lutaonan.com/">Randy</a>. It&rsquo;s very lightweight, only about 5kb after gzipping. From the name, you can see it&rsquo;s hard to bear Disqus, so he made an alternative version. Therefore, it also supports importing historical data from Disqus, which is very thoughtful.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using it since mid-2021, exactly three years now. Except for the initial hassle with deployment platforms due to Heroku and Railway successively charging, it has been running steadily. However, I&rsquo;ve also encountered some issues in use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Probably due to some modifications made by WeChat&rsquo;s built-in browser, the comment component can&rsquo;t be seen when the blog is opened from WeChat chat/dialogue.</li>
<li>Although you can enter an email address, it doesn&rsquo;t support subscribing to comment replies.</li>
<li>The administrator needs to manually review comments, but the TG Bot for comment notifications often fails, causing missed comments.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, overall, it&rsquo;s still a highly recommended solution even today. It&rsquo;s lightweight, easy to self-deploy, and has a minimalist and good-looking style. For setup instructions, refer to &ldquo;Lightweight Open Source Free Blog Comment System Solution (Cusdis + Railway)&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Given that Railway has cancelled its Free Plan since August last year, if you still want to use it completely free, you can use Vercel/Netlify/Zeabur to deploy the main project for free, and deploy a free PostgreSQL database instance on <a href="https://supabase.com">Supabase</a>, passing the link as an environment variable to the Cusdis service. Other procedures are similar.</p>
<p>Also, because its core features haven&rsquo;t been updated for a long time, it seems a bit rudimentary compared to other more mature commenting systems. However, as I also adhere to the principle of &ldquo;good enough is good enough&rdquo;, I never had the idea of migrating/updating. I only participated in some development of the Cusdis V2 version for a while when I was learning front-end, but I didn&rsquo;t do it for long.</p>
<p>Due to the constant failure of Vercel deployment upgrades in April, which caused me to not receive comments for nearly a few weeks, plus I did have some functional requirements, so I made up my mind to migrate and explored new solutions.</p>
<h3 id="remark42--flyio">Remark42 + fly.io</h3>
<p>After researching around, I chose <a href="https://remark42.com/">Remark42</a> which <a href="https://reorx.com/">reorx</a> finally selected in the article &ldquo;Changing Blog Commenting Systems&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Just in terms of configuration options, it&rsquo;s much richer than Cusdis. Currently, I&rsquo;ve configured several common social account logins (GitHub, Twitter, Telegram, email), anonymous commenting is allowed, it supports email subscription for reply notifications, and I&rsquo;ve also set up TG bot notifications. It&rsquo;s deployed on <a href="https://fly.io">fly.io</a>, with go single binary + single file database, a very comfortable solution. For more detailed introduction and advantages of Remark42, you can refer to the article mentioned above.</p>
<p>Although Remark42 provides some migration solutions, it doesn&rsquo;t inherently support Cusdis which I was using. But since it&rsquo;s written in Golang, I added migration logic myself and seamlessly migrated the 438 comments data accumulated over these years.</p>
<h2 id="remark42--flyio-deployment-instructions">Remark42 + fly.io Deployment Instructions</h2>
<p>The Remark42 + fly.io solution only involves a single service, with the database using boltdb mounted in a volume, but all operations are within fly.io&rsquo;s Free Plan.</p>
<p>Below, I&rsquo;ll introduce how to build this free commenting system from scratch.</p>
<p>Remark42&rsquo;s code itself is open source - &ldquo;GitHub - umputun/remark42&rdquo;, and it provides an officially maintained image. The documentation is clear and easy to read, and you can configure it according to your actual needs.</p>
<h3 id="install-flyctl-command-line-tool">Install <code>flyctl</code> Command Line Tool</h3>
<p><a href="https://fly.io">fly.io</a> differs greatly from Railway, Zeabur, etc. that I used before in that most operations are based on command line and configuration files, rather than operating in a web management backend. So first, you need to install the <code>flyctl</code> command line tool according to the <a href="https://fly.io/docs/flyctl/install/">documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Taking macOS as an example, I use <code>brew</code> for installation:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">brew install flyctl
</span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id="authorize-login">Authorize Login</h3>
<p>Open the terminal tool and use the following command for authorized login:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">flyctl auth login
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/fly_auth_login.png" alt="fly_auth_login"></p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/fly_auth_web.png" alt="fly_auth_web"></p>
<p>Log in to your account or create a new account on the web end. After completion, click &ldquo;Continue as xxx&rdquo; to complete the authorization login of the <code>flyctl</code> command line.</p>
<h3 id="create-application-directory">Create Application Directory</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/create_fly_config.png" alt="create_fly_config"></p>
<p>Since I usually manually manage configurations rather than using their official templates, I create a directory like <code>remark42-on-fly</code> and put all configuration files, environment variables, etc. in this path.</p>
<p>And use VS Code for editing (you can also use vim or other editors/IDEs).</p>
<h3 id="configuration-file">Configuration File</h3>
<p>fly.io mainly uses <code>.toml</code> format configuration files for service management. Here is the configuration file corresponding to the service I deployed:</p>

<h3 id="import-environment-variables-to-service">Import Environment Variables to Service</h3>
<p>After completing the environment variable configuration according to the above instructions, run the following command in the directory where the configuration file and environment variable file are located to import the environment variables:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">fly secrets import &lt; prod.env
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/fly_secret_import.png" alt="fly_secret_import"></p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/deploy_status_remark42.png" alt="deploy_status_remark42"></p>
<p>After execution, check the service status in the fly.io console. If the status is <code>Deployed</code>, it indicates successful deployment.</p>
<h3 id="configure-custom-domain-optional">Configure Custom Domain (Optional)</h3>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t want to use the default domain provided by fly.io, you can configure a custom domain.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/custom_domain_flyio.png" alt="custom_domain_flyio"></p>
<p>Enter the fly.io console, select the <code>yu-remark42-01</code> service you just deployed, click the <code>Certificates</code> option on the left, then click <code>Add a Certificate</code> in the upper right corner, and follow the prompts to add a custom domain.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/custom_domain_dns_in_fly.png" alt="custom_domain_dns_in_fly"></p>
<p>After clicking <code>Create Certificate</code>, there will be a page showing the DNS records you need to add. Follow the prompts to add them.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/cloudflare_dns_remark42.png" alt="cloudflare_dns_remark42"></p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/flyio_certificate_success.png" alt="flyio_certificate_success"></p>
<p>For example, my domain is hosted on Cloudflare, I added two DNS records according to the prompts. Return to the page and click <code>Check again</code> or wait for a while and refresh to view. If all show green, the configuration is successful.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/change_remark_url.png" alt="change_remark_url"></p>
<p>At this point, we can modify <code>REMARK_URL</code> to the custom domain in <code>fly.toml</code>, then execute the following command to redeploy the service. Any subsequent changes to the configuration file can be updated using this command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">fly deploy

<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve completed the deployment of the Remark42 service, we need to add the Remark42 comment component to our blog posts. I&rsquo;ll use my Hugo blog as an example.</p>
<h3 id="define-hugo-theme-comments-component">Define Hugo Theme Comments Component</h3>
<p>I created a new <code>comments.html</code> file in the <code>layouts/partials</code> directory of my Hugo blog to define the Remark42 comment component:</p>

<p>I exported the comment data from Cusdis in JSON format according to certain conditions, and converted and migrated the format through a Go program, thus preserving all previous comments.</p>
<p>Because Cusdis itself doesn&rsquo;t provide an export function and the migration need is too niche, I didn&rsquo;t directly contribute code to the upstream or write it into a complete script.

<p>This piece records and reflects on my life from July 10 to July 21, 2024.</p>
<p>This week and a half has been quite eventful. Work has been somewhat busy. I participated in the Adventure X event, which was a lot of fun. I experimented with the Remix framework and prepared for a workshop. I met with Randy, and together we planned the redesign and subsequent development of EpubKit, essentially holding our own hackathon for us &ldquo;middle-aged hippies&rdquo; who couldn&rsquo;t participate in the competition. I switched from Obsidian to Apple Notes, implementing P.A.R.A. I&rsquo;m planning to paint the walls of my garage. I visited the Apple Store to experience the Apple Vision Pro. And there were many other interesting happenings.</p>
<h2 id="adventure-x">Adventure X</h2>
<p>This was a hackathon event for young developers aged 26 and under. I had heard about it early on but was unfortunately just over the age limit to participate. However, I was invited to be a judge for the &ldquo;Web 3.0 Development Tools&rdquo; track sponsored by OpenBuild and to be a workshop instructor on-site, allowing me to observe the entire process.</p>
<p>The event attracted nearly 200 developers, and their energy and passion were palpable (perhaps the 26-year age limit makes sense after all). I also met many familiar faces from Twitter and &ldquo;Crazy Thursday&rdquo;, and had interesting conversations with several new and old friends.</p>
<h3 id="workshop">Workshop</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/adventurex_workshop.jpg" alt="adventurex_workshop"></p>
<p>My main task was to serve as a mentor and workshop instructor, with the theme &ldquo;Building a Full-Stack AdventureX Badge ÐApp Using Solidity and Remix&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve given quite a few lessons and workshops in various settings. Initially, I was just helping out Ian&rsquo;s OpenBuild community, as I enjoy writing tutorials and sharing knowledge. But as these opportunities became more frequent, I noticed some changes in myself. I no longer use the same slides to repeat similar content each time. Instead, I treat each occasion as a new learning opportunity for myself, challenging myself to create something interesting within a limited time frame and then teach it. It&rsquo;s a kind of practice of the Feynman learning technique.</p>
<p>For this workshop, I wanted to learn the Remix frontend framework. I wrote a simple ÐApp for claiming event badges. You can experience it at &ldquo;adventure-x.pseudoyu.com&rdquo;, and the PPT slides are available at &ldquo;AdventureX_Workshop_20240716.pdf&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Although I knew about this workshop about a month in advance, I inevitably procrastinated until the last couple of days. I spent one evening learning from Randy&rsquo;s &ldquo;Remix Practical Guide&rdquo; booklet and completed the UI part. The next evening, I wrote the Solidity contract part and finished the interaction logic between the frontend and the contract, then deployed it online using Zeabur. Procrastination is truly a killer.</p>
<p>But Remix is indeed user-friendly. I achieved the feat of completing an application with zero useEffect and zero useState. I&rsquo;m considering whether it can completely replace Next.js in various scenarios in the future.</p>
<p>More people showed up on-site than I expected. The workshop ran for twice as long as the planned 45 minutes, ending close to 10 pm. However, it was an interesting experience, and the workshop was quite successful.</p>
<h3 id="middle-aged-hippie-hackathon">&ldquo;Middle-aged Hippie&rdquo; Hackathon</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/code_with_randy_hackathon.png" alt="code_with_randy_hackathon"></p>
<p>Randy also came from Guangdong as a guest judge. We both felt that just observing the hackathon atmosphere was a bit too boring, so we decided to work on the redesign of EpubKit together.</p>
<p>We discussed the current operation logic and UI style changes for the entire EpubKit. It was very enjoyable. We spent several hours developing together in the evening, finding a sense of participation as &ldquo;middle-aged hippies&rdquo;. We also discussed many ideas and division of labor for the future of the product, which I&rsquo;m looking forward to.</p>
<p>Everyone is welcome to download and experience <a href="https://epubkit.app/">EpubKit</a> to create your own e-books.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/yu_with_randy.jpg" alt="yu_with_randy"></p>
<p>As someone who doesn&rsquo;t like taking photos, I happened to be captured by the staff while looking at project exhibitions with Randy. It&rsquo;s quite a memorable photo.</p>
<h2 id="para-practice-based-on-apple-notes">P.A.R.A Practice Based on Apple Notes</h2>
<p>Last month, I switched from Logseq, which I had used for two years, to Obsidian. After about a month of practice, I developed more recording habits compared to when I was using Logseq. Although I no longer need to worry about folder hierarchies and such, I still need to overcome the mental burden brought by the chain of &ldquo;recording ideas in my mind&rdquo; -&gt; &ldquo;waiting until I&rsquo;m at the computer to create a new file and give it a title&rdquo; -&gt; &ldquo;organizing ideas and adding tags&rdquo; -&gt; &ldquo;writing down the content&rdquo;.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/apple_notes_folders_20240721.png" alt="apple_notes_folders_20240721"></p>
<p>Randy told me about his method of using Apple Notes to record all ideas and notes, and categorizing them through the P.A.R.A hierarchy. I found that when there&rsquo;s no burden of organizing, and you can just open your phone/computer to record ideas anytime without considering format or markdown syntax, there&rsquo;s more desire to record. And being able to record and take action is the core purpose of note-taking.</p>
<p>On Mac, you can use Quick Notes in the bottom right corner for quick recording. On iOS, you can use shortcuts to quickly save fleeting ideas to the Drafts directory. Later, when you have more ideas, you can move them to various directories. It&rsquo;s a simple yet effective practice that doesn&rsquo;t require specifying various tags and categories. When needed, you can just use full-text search.</p>
<h2 id="other-matters">Other Matters</h2>
<h3 id="wall-painting">Wall Painting</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/car_painting_wall.jpg" alt="car_painting_wall"></p>
<p>After learning oil painting and painting a portrait last time, I found it very interesting. Recently, I decided to challenge myself with something fun again. Together with my senior, we&rsquo;re planning to use acrylic paint to paint an entire cement wall in my father&rsquo;s auto repair shop (I&rsquo;ll be the assistant).</p>
<p>We sent my father&rsquo;s ideas and reference images we found on Instagram to DALL-E, and the generated effect is quite good. I hope we can have the finished product in August 🤩.</p>
<h3 id="apple-vision-pro">Apple Vision Pro</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/apple_vision_pro_experience.jpg" alt="apple_vision_pro_experience"></p>
<p>On Thursday this week, I went to Apple West Lake to experience the Vision Pro. Actually, I had been paying attention to it very early and had watched a lot of reviews. I was quite tempted at one point, but having had the experience of my Quest 2 gathering dust, I was still on the fence.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, the Chinese version was also launched, so I made an appointment for a half-hour experience. From fitting the lenses, explaining the accessories, to experiencing various functions and applications, the experience was better than I imagined. I didn&rsquo;t feel any dizziness or pressure from the weight in the 20 minutes or so.</p>
<p>In actual experience, the interaction was more fluid, natural, and accurate than I imagined. However, there was still quite noticeable noise in the image, and the resolution was not sufficient for an immersive experience, although it was quite impressive. There are still too few supported applications, so it&rsquo;s more of a novelty experience without many application scenarios. The typing experience is poor, so an external keyboard is still needed. Overall, this generation is not worth buying. Perhaps we&rsquo;ll consider it when both the price and the system application layer are more refined in the future.</p>
<h3 id="chatgpt-plus---claude-pro">ChatGPT Plus -&gt; Claude Pro</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/claude_pro_sub.jpg" alt="claude_pro_sub"></p>
<p>Last month, due to high-frequency usage, I resubscribed to ChatGPT Plus while using Claude 3.5 Sonnet under the free quota. I found that Claude&rsquo;s contextual understanding ability and the usability of generated results for code were significantly better than GPT4. So when it expired this week, I decided to switch to a Claude Pro subscription to try it out for another month at the same price.</p>
<h3 id="guii-experience">Guii Experience</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/guii.jpg" alt="guii"></p>
<p><a href="https://guii.ai/">Guii</a> was the most interesting project I saw at this Adventure X hackathon. It allows you to interact with the frontend page directly through natural language dialogue, and it will directly modify the source code to achieve interesting effects.</p>
<p>I made a very simple cryptocurrency website through simple dialogue by selecting elements. There are still some bugs, but it&rsquo;s highly playable.</p>
<p>I awarded them the OpenBuild Sponsor track prize, which was well-deserved. I hope it can go online soon 🔥.</p>

<p>This piece is a reflection on life from July 1st to July 9th, 2024.</p>
<p>This week, I maintained an early rising routine for several days, dedicating time to reading and studying with high efficiency. However, establishing a regular pattern still requires time and adjustment. I&rsquo;m also exploring how to enter and switch work modes more swiftly. I&rsquo;m simultaneously reading several books: &ldquo;Atlas Shrugged&rdquo;, &ldquo;Normal People&rdquo;, and &ldquo;What My Bones Know&rdquo;. A conversation with my senior about her current read, &ldquo;Stoner&rdquo;, sparked some thoughts about various dimensions of life. Many other interesting events unfolded as well.</p>
<h2 id="normal-people-and-stoner">Normal People and Stoner</h2>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/normal_people.webp" alt="normal_people"></p>
<p>&ldquo;Normal People&rdquo; is an English TV series I watched long ago, perhaps in 2020 or 2021. It left a deep impression on me. Recently, recalling it, I decided to read the original novel. Although much of the content revolves around love and school trivialities, I saw much of myself in the male protagonist - the timidity and insecurity rooted deep within, the obsession with life&rsquo;s perplexities yet unwillingness to be ordinary, and ultimately, the resignation to life as it is. &ldquo;Stoner&rdquo; was one of the books I chose from a recent lucky draw book blind box. I&rsquo;ve read it twice before, and while the plot details have faded, there&rsquo;s a sense of renewed insight with each recollection. It uses plain strokes to outline life in its original form.</p>
<p>These two books, when connected, led me to reconsider some value propositions about self and life.</p>
<h3 id="life-is-here">Life Is Here</h3>
<p>Last night, my senior and I had a rare outing to a nearby Japanese restaurant. Our attire was quite amusing as we set out from our respective homes. She wore an elegant dress on top, paired with slippers; I wasn&rsquo;t much better, sporting a dress shirt with athletic shorts and slippers. As we sat at the counter waiting for our meal and chatting, there was a sense of half ceremony, half everyday life in our mismatched outfits, yet it didn&rsquo;t feel strange - just like life companions.</p>
<p>We often say &ldquo;life is elsewhere&rdquo;, implying that life elsewhere always seems more attractive. But looking back, life right here has its own unique charm.</p>
<p>We talked about our current lives, feeling there isn&rsquo;t much to complain about. She&rsquo;s doing well in a job she neither particularly likes nor dislikes, while I&rsquo;m content in my own field. The pace of life in Hangzhou is better than the bustle of Beijing; we often take walks or enjoy home-cooked meals. Yet we both seem to have expectations - she wants to paint, and I want to leave this comfort zone to start a new chapter of life in another country. But these expectations are masked by our satisfactory current state of life. It&rsquo;s harder to extricate ourselves, after all, decisions not driven by real needs are always more difficult, as if we bear the responsibility of disrupting the tranquility of life.</p>
<h3 id="the-illusory-meaning">The Illusory Meaning</h3>
<p>During my college years and the first couple of years after graduation, I often had juniors asking for advice about switching to coding or making life choices. Even now, some friends who know me from technical tutorials or courses ask about learning Web3 and industry insights. I&rsquo;ve always been cautious and sincere in responding to them, often thinking that if I had received some advice earlier, I might have avoided some detours. But I&rsquo;m wary of my tone and stance, not wanting to become &ldquo;preachy&rdquo; due to survivor bias.</p>
<p>So I often meticulously list out pros and cons and my own thoughts based on their individual situations, sending seven or eight consecutive messages, still worried I might have missed something. But in eight or nine out of ten cases, they would end up asking these few questions, as if everything I said was irrelevant and not the answer they wanted, with a sense of absurd revelation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Is computer science very lucrative? How can I successfully switch to coding?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are Web3 salaries really high?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I used to like a quote from a long-ago admired but now inactive blog writer, which appeared at the end of each article. It roughly meant:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you all the truths I know, so that you won&rsquo;t live this life well.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes I wonder if it&rsquo;s precisely because I pursue illusory meaning too much, merely clinging to some principles, that I&rsquo;ve made myself less happy. The more one knows, the harder it becomes to move forward. Life is but thirty thousand days; perhaps if we were content with external things, content with life itself, life would be more &ldquo;relaxed&rdquo;.</p>
<p>So there was a long period of silence, no longer questioning myself and the world, enjoying the present, only to harvest more emptiness.</p>
<h2 id="other-matters">Other Matters</h2>
<h3 id="work-state">Work State</h3>
<p>Recently, I&rsquo;ve been working on a somewhat troublesome requirement for about a week. Technically, there aren&rsquo;t any particularly difficult points - it&rsquo;s mainly about reading configurations from the blockchain and scheduling various service restarts (but not from the k8s or other deployment level, rather the program needs to handle it internally). Therefore, there are many details to consider in the chain, requiring focus and meticulousness.</p>
<p>This week, I also practiced getting up at 5 AM for immersive blog writing, reading, learning Rust, etc., gradually adjusting to work mode around 9 AM until evening. Because the efficiency of early rising is quite high, I found it actually difficult/slow to switch from a learning state to a fully focused work state. This is what Randy mentioned in last week&rsquo;s &ldquo;Code Outside&rdquo; anniversary live stream about &ldquo;single-threading&rdquo; and &ldquo;context switching&rdquo; - the inability to deeply think about and do two things simultaneously.</p>
<p>I also recall last week when I went to work with my colleague Ares at a coffee shop in Liangzhu. Although we only chatted casually during work, not strongly related to the work content, it seemed to immediately draw us into a good work atmosphere. Sometimes it&rsquo;s not so easy to achieve this at home, which is probably one of the drawbacks of remote work.</p>

<li><a href="http://movie.douban.com/subject/26656728/"><strong>The Swimmer</strong></a>, I feel the Chinese translation of the title &ldquo;Young Woman and the Sea&rdquo; as &ldquo;The Swimmer&rsquo;s Heart&rdquo; is a bit too bland. After watching, &ldquo;The Old Lady and the Sea&rdquo; might be more fitting 🤣 The themes of sportsmanship, femininity, and inspiration aren&rsquo;t particularly novel, but the portrayal of the protagonist&rsquo;s growth and her support system is just right. The protagonist&rsquo;s mother and coach Abby are also impressive. My senior had previously signed up for the Hong Kong Victoria Harbour cross-harbour swim and is now preparing for the Qiantang River swim in Hangzhou. While the difficulty can&rsquo;t compare to the English Channel, watching this seems to have given me a better understanding of the obsession and charm involved.</li>

<p>In the article &ldquo;Building Your Free Image Hosting System from Scratch (Cloudflare R2 + WebP Cloud + PicGo)&rdquo;, I constructed a free image hosting system using Cloudflare R2 and optimized images through <a href="https://webp.se/">WebP Cloud</a>.</p>
<p>While using WebP Cloud, I discovered it offered features like custom Proxy User Agent and watermarking. This sparked an idea: could I use WebP Cloud to protect the source links of my image hosting, making WebP Cloud&rsquo;s proxy links the sole entry point for accessing all my images, while also uniformly adding my exclusive copyright watermark?</p>
<p>This article documents this practice, serving as a supplementary chapter to the image hosting setup.</p>
<h2 id="requirement-analysis">Requirement Analysis</h2>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/webp_proxy_info.png" alt="webp_proxy_info"></p>
<p>My current image hosting solution involves hosting images on Cloudflare R2 and accessing them through WebP Cloud, a powerful image proxy tool for optimization. However, both the proxy link <code>image.pseudoyu.com</code> and the source link <code>images.pseudoyu.com</code> can access my images, with the former being optimized and the latter being the original image I saved.</p>
<h3 id="privacy-protection">Privacy Protection</h3>
<p>In fact, photos taken with our phones, digital cameras, and other devices carry EXIF (EXchangeable Image File Format) information, which usually includes sensitive data such as the shooting device, time, and location. We can manually remove this metadata through some technical means, but the process is cumbersome and prone to oversight.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/webp_exif_remove.png" alt="webp_exif_remove"></p>
<p>Upon consulting WebP Cloud&rsquo;s documentation, I found that it indeed provides automatic EXIF information erasure without additional configuration. However, visitors can still access the original image through the source link exposed by Cloudflare R2. To prevent this, I need to restrict users to only request through WebP Cloud proxy links, ensuring they cannot obtain any useful information when accessing the Cloudflare R2 source links.</p>
<h3 id="copyright-protection">Copyright Protection</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/randy_pic_copyright.png" alt="randy_pic_copyright"></p>
<p>I previously saw Randy&rsquo;s experience on Twitter of his own desk setup photo being misused.</p>
<p>As someone who dabbles in photography myself, although my work may not have particular commercial value, it is still my creation and deserves copyright protection. Therefore, I want to uniformly add my own copyright watermark to the images to prevent unauthorized use by others.</p>
<h2 id="implementation-plan">Implementation Plan</h2>
<p>With the requirements clear, the task essentially divides into two parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ensure users can only access my images through WebP Cloud proxy links, prohibiting direct access to original image links.</li>
<li>Automatically add my copyright watermark to all images at the WebP Cloud proxy level, without manual intervention.</li>
</ol>
<p>Below is my implementation plan with detailed steps.</p>
<h3 id="webp-custom-user-agent--cloudflare-waf">WebP Custom User Agent + Cloudflare WAF</h3>
<p>After chatting with <a href="https://x.com/n0vad3v">Nova Kwok</a>, the developer of <a href="https://webp.se/">WebP Cloud</a>, I discovered that WebP Cloud provides a custom &ldquo;Proxy User Agent&rdquo; feature. He recommended configuring corresponding rules in Cloudflare WAF to protect image security, as detailed in the documentation &ndash; &ldquo;<a href="https://docs.webp.se/webp-cloud/security/#cloudflare">Security | WebP Cloud Services Docs</a>&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 id="webp-cloud-configuration">WebP Cloud Configuration</h4>
<p>When we access web pages or image links on the internet, the request usually includes a User Agent field, generally containing information such as browser version. Websites can perform specific logic processing for different User Agents.</p>
<p>WebP Cloud defaults to using <code>WebP Cloud Services/1.0</code> as the value, meaning that regardless of what terminal device or browser the user is using to access the image, the request to Cloudflare R2 will be unified as the User Agent value defined by WebP Cloud, which is customizable by the user.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/webp_custom_user_agent.png" alt="webp_custom_user_agent"></p>
<p>Therefore, we log into the WebP Cloud console and set the &ldquo;Proxy User Agent&rdquo; field to a custom value, such as <code>pseudoyu.com/1.0</code>.</p>
<h4 id="cloudflare-waf-configuration">Cloudflare WAF Configuration</h4>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/cloudflare_waf_intro.png" alt="cloudflare_waf_intro"></p>
<p><a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf">WAF (Web Application Firewall)</a> is a firewall service provided by Cloudflare that allows custom rules to be set to restrict specific requests for website security. After logging into Cloudflare, click on &ldquo;Websites&rdquo; in the left sidebar, enter the domain name you want to protect, select &ldquo;Security&rdquo; - &ldquo;WAF&rdquo; in the sidebar to use it for free (Note: This is not the account-level WAF on the outermost layer). Free accounts can set up to five custom rules.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/waf_create_rule.png" alt="waf_create_rule"></p>
<p>Click &ldquo;Create Rule&rdquo; to enter the settings page.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/user_agent_protection_waf.png" alt="user_agent_protection_waf"></p>
<p>Click &ldquo;Edit Expression&rdquo; to the right of &ldquo;Expression Preview&rdquo; and enter the following rule:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-plaintext" data-lang="plaintext"><span class="line"><span class="cl">(http.user_agent ne &#34;pseudoyu.com/1.0&#34;) and (http.host eq &#34;images.pseudoyu.com&#34;)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>First, you need to replace <code>pseudoyu.com/1.0</code> with the custom User Agent value you set in WebP Cloud earlier. Additionally, to prevent images from other self-deployed services on the same domain from being affected, I added the condition <code>(http.host eq &quot;images.pseudoyu.com&quot;)</code>, which only applies to the access link of the image hosting. This part needs to be replaced with your own image hosting domain host.</p>
<p>Select &ldquo;Block&rdquo; from the &ldquo;Select Action&rdquo; dropdown. This will match our rule and block specific network requests. Click &ldquo;Deploy/Save&rdquo; after editing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m using the <a href="https://docs.webp.se/webp-cloud/security/#cloudflare">recommended rule</a> currently provided in the official WebP Cloud documentation. It may be adjusted for new features in the future, so you can refer directly to the documentation.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/block_by_waf_example.png" alt="block_by_waf_example"></p>
<p>After completing the configuration, when we try to access source links starting with <code>images.pseudoyu.com</code> again, they will be blocked by WAF, for example:</p>
<p><a href="https://images.pseudoyu.com/images/new_mbp_setup.jpg">images.pseudoyu.com/images/new_mbp_setup.jpg</a></p>
<p>However, links proxied through WebP Cloud can be accessed normally, for example:</p>
<p><a href="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/new_mbp_setup.jpg">image.pseudoyu.com/images/new_mbp_setup.jpg</a></p>
<p>This perfectly meets our requirements.</p>
<h3 id="adding-copyright-watermark-to-images-using-webp-cloud">Adding Copyright Watermark to Images Using WebP Cloud</h3>
<p>After the operations above, we have ensured that users can only access our images through WebP Cloud proxy links. The next step is to add copyright watermarks to the images.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/webp_watermark_feature.png" alt="webp_watermark_feature"></p>
<p>Again, upon consulting WebP Cloud&rsquo;s documentation, I found that it provides a &ldquo;Watermark&rdquo; feature in the &ldquo;Visual Effects&rdquo; module, which can add custom watermarks to images. It uses the <code>Fabric.js</code> library for implementation and offers some visual editing options. They even wrote an interesting blog post &ndash; &ldquo;<a href="https://blog.webp.se/dashboard-fabric-zh/">Implementing Real-time Watermark Preview with Fabric.js</a>&rdquo;.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/watermark_list_webp.png" alt="watermark_list_webp"></p>
<p>Enter the WebP console, select &ldquo;Visual Effects&rdquo; on the left, and click &ldquo;Create Watermark&rdquo; in the upper right corner to configure some custom watermark styles.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/pseudoyu_copyright.png" alt="pseudoyu_copyright"></p>
<p>This is my configuration, which adds a light gray <code>@pseudoyu</code> text at the bottom center of the image.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/webp_purge_all_cache.png" alt="webp_purge_all_cache"></p>
<p>Note that WebP Cloud caches image data for users. Therefore, if you want previously uploaded images to apply the watermark or update to a new watermark, you need to click &ldquo;Purge All Cache&rdquo; in the proxy configuration to clear the cache.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/apply_watermark_webp.png" alt="apply_watermark_webp"></p>
<p>After editing the watermark, go to the detailed configuration page of the proxy, scroll down to the &ldquo;Watermark Setting&rdquo; module, select the watermark you just created, and click &ldquo;Save&rdquo; in the upper right corner.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t demonstrate the effect separately, as all the images in this article have had watermarks added in this way.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/webp_thoughts.png" alt="webp_thoughts"></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only been three days since I started using <a href="https://webp.se/">WebP Cloud</a>, and initially, I thought it was just a CDN-like tool for accelerating image access. After tinkering with it, I discovered many interesting aspects. The Free Quota provided for individual free users is sufficient to give everyone a better image experience, which aligns with their principle of &ldquo;doing the right thing&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The team focuses more on technical accumulation and practice, writing numerous blog posts &ndash; &ldquo;<a href="https://blog.webp.se/">WebP Cloud Services Blog</a>&rdquo;. Reading these in leisure time, one can feel their enthusiasm. Recently, due to an experience shared in &ldquo;Weekly Review #63 - An Unpleasant Flower Ordering Experience, Merchants and Consumers, and the Increasingly AI-driven World&rdquo;, I&rsquo;ve been pondering the issue of &ldquo;bad money driving out good&rdquo;. I believe teams that insist on doing the right thing without making too many compromises to commercialization deserve to be seen by more people and deserve to fare better. Though my influence is limited, I hope these tutorials can help more people learn about them.</p>

<p>On Friday, my 2C2G server purchased from BandwagonHost suddenly reported a kernel error, making it impossible to connect via SSH or restart. After a series of circuitous rescue attempts, I finally managed to salvage over a thousand images from my image hosting service. Still shaken by the experience, I&rsquo;d like to document the rescue process and, incidentally, discuss the new image hosting solution I&rsquo;ve set up.</p>
<h2 id="server-rescue">Server Rescue</h2>
<p>This server had been running stably for about a year and a half, hosting many of my critical services, including over a thousand irreplaceable images for my blog&rsquo;s image hosting service, persistently stored on the host via Docker Volume.</p>
<h3 id="server-downtime">Server Downtime</h3>
<p>To this day, I&rsquo;m still uncertain about what exactly went wrong. That morning, I needed to update the image version of my RSSHub instance running on the server. I thought I might as well update all services to their latest versions. So, I ran a series of <code>docker pull</code> and <code>docker-compose</code> restart operations. Everything seemed fine until the last service suddenly failed to start its container, reporting an error similar to <code>not enough space</code>. I assumed that downloading too many images might have filled up the disk, so I ran a series of <code>docker image prune --all</code>, <code>docker volume prune</code>, and <code>docker system prune</code> commands, freeing up nearly 10GB of space. I tried again, but it still didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>As a developer with only a smidgen of server maintenance experience, my first instinct was to restart. Little did I know, this would mark the beginning of a day-long nightmare.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/uptime_kuma_status.png" alt="uptime_kuma_status"></p>
<p>After the restart, my Uptime Kuma alerted me that all services were offline, and I could no longer connect to the machine via SSH.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/bwg_kernel_panic.jpg" alt="bwg_kernel_panic"></p>
<p>I quickly logged into BandwagonHost&rsquo;s online console, only to discover a kernel error preventing startup. Even a forced restart proved ineffective. I immediately submitted a support ticket and reached out to my DevOps friends for help.</p>
<h3 id="data-rescue">Data Rescue</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/ask_strrl_about_vps.png" alt="ask_strrl_about_vps"></p>
<p>STRRL suggested that there might be an issue with the <code>rootfs</code>. However, given that this small cloud provider doesn&rsquo;t offer advanced boot options or other additional features, we could only wait for official technical support. Still, the thought of losing a year and a half&rsquo;s worth of unbackup image hosting data made me anxious, so I started looking for ways to rescue the data.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/bwg_vps_snapshot.png" alt="bwg_vps_snapshot"></p>
<p>After investigating BandwagonHost&rsquo;s console, I found that they provide weekly backups that can be instantly converted into snapshots. The most recent one was from June 22nd, which was fortunate. My first thought was to restore the machine directly from the snapshot. If today&rsquo;s operations had caused some configuration issue, then a snapshot from a week ago should boot normally. Full of hope, I waited about ten minutes for the snapshot restoration, only to encounter the same error. Still not giving up, I tried restoring the June 15th backup as well, but to no avail.</p>
<p>At this point, I realized the gravity of the situation and even prepared for the worst-case scenario of losing all data. While waiting for a response to my support ticket, I started searching for similar cases and eventually discovered that BandwagonHost&rsquo;s snapshot images can be downloaded. I found an article titled &ldquo;Tutorial on downloading, unzipping, and viewing data from BandwagonHost backup snapshot image files .tar.gz and .disk files.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, I downloaded the snapshot image and obtained a <code>.disk</code> file. This file seemed to be in a proprietary format. According to the tutorial, it can be converted using Virtual Box&rsquo;s command-line tool <code>vboxmanage convertfromraw</code>. However, after downloading from the official website, I found it doesn&rsquo;t support M-chip Macs. So, I installed and executed the conversion on my old 2019 Intel Mac, resulting in a <code>.vmdk</code> file.</p>
<p>After the conversion, I mounted this <code>.vmdk</code> as a disk on a Virtual Box CentOS virtual machine, only to encounter the same error.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/7zip_format.png" alt="7zip_format"></p>
<p>So, I tried a different approach and found that the <a href="https://arc.net/l/quote/tirhqejc">7-Zip</a> software supports extracting common virtual machine formats, but the client is only available for Windows.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/x7z_vmdk_x.jpg" alt="x7z_vmdk_x"></p>
<p>Although theoretically, I could use the command-line version <a href="https://github.com/p7zip-project/p7zip">p7zip</a> on macOS, I encountered errors during extraction. So, that avenue was blocked too. I came up with a roundabout solution: I downloaded a Win11 virtual machine, installed the 7-Zip software, and successfully extracted the files.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/fuse_load_img.png" alt="fuse_load_img"></p>
<p>Another problem arose: the resulting files were Linux disk image files in <code>1.img</code>, <code>2.img</code> format, which couldn&rsquo;t be loaded on macOS. I asked my company&rsquo;s operations team, tried fiddling with fuse, but still couldn&rsquo;t load them.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/ufs_load_img_log.jpg" alt="ufs_load_img_log"></p>
<p>There was some good news during this time. While scouring the internet, I discovered a data recovery software called UFS Explorer. I tried it and found it could load the files normally, except that files over 768k required a paid version. Of course, I didn&rsquo;t intend to pay, but seeing that the files were indeed readable gave me peace of mind. At least the data was there; the rest was just a technical problem.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/bwg_reply.png" alt="bwg_reply"></p>
<p>Meanwhile, BandwagonHost responded to my ticket, suggesting I try restarting or reinstalling&hellip; 🤣</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/str_orbstack_img.png" alt="str_orbstack_img"></p>
<p>Giving up on ticket communication, I continued trying to rescue my data from the <code>img</code> file. The ever-resourceful STRRL told me that OrbStack can start a Linux Machine, and I could mount this <code>img</code> as a Linux disk.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">sudo losetup -fP 1.img
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">mkdir /mnt/bwg
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">sudo mount /dev/loop0 /mnt/bwg
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Using these commands, I successfully mounted my <code>img</code> disk image to the OrbStack Ubuntu machine.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/rescue_image_from_bwg_img.png" alt="rescue_image_from_bwg_img"></p>
<p>When I saw my images appear in the command line output, I was almost moved to tears 😭.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">tar -czvf cheverto_chevereto_images.tar.gz cheverto_chevereto_images/
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">rsync -acvP ./cheverto_chevereto_images.tar.gz pseudoyu@<span class="o">[</span>yu-mac-studio<span class="o">]</span>:~/Downloads/
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/rsync_service.jpg" alt="rsync_service"></p>
<p>I quickly created a <code>tar</code> package and transferred it to my local Mac using <code>rsync</code>. After extracting it locally, I finally saw all my images.</p>
<h3 id="migrating-the-image-hosting-system-to-r2">Migrating the Image Hosting System to r2</h3>
<p>However, due to this experience, I no longer trust the stability of server-based image hosting. I spent half a day setting up a new free image hosting system — &ldquo;Building Your Free Image Hosting System from Scratch (Cloudflare R2 + WebP Cloud + PicGo)&rdquo;.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/rclone_service.jpg" alt="rclone_service"></p>
<p>As for uploading existing data to <code>r2</code>, I used <code>rclone</code> to complete the migration. Mission accomplished!</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve started reconsidering issues of service deployment and data security. I plan to move some important data to the cloud rather than relying on single machines, and continue migrating some services to serverless platforms like <a href="https://fly.io">fly.io</a> and <a href="https://zeabur.com/">Zeabur</a>.</p>

<p>This piece records and reflects on my life from June 24 to June 30, 2024.</p>
<p>An unpleasant flower ordering and rights protection experience led me to ponder the relationship between merchants and consumers, as well as the phenomenon of humans becoming more AI-like while AI becomes increasingly human-like. On Friday, my server suddenly experienced a Kernel Panic and couldn&rsquo;t reboot. After various roundabout rescue attempts, I finally salvaged over a thousand images from the image bed, leaving me feeling quite shaken. I took the opportunity to tinker with a new image bed solution. Realizing it had been over two years since I last wrote a blog setup tutorial, and considering the many changes in both content and components, I decided to restart the series.</p>
<h2 id="an-unpleasant-flower-ordering-experience">An Unpleasant Flower Ordering Experience</h2>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/refund_flower.jpg" alt="refund_flower"></p>
<p>A very unpleasant incident occurred over the weekend (which is still unresolved due to the merchant&rsquo;s refusal to collect the goods).</p>
<p>June 30th marked the one-year anniversary of my relationship with my senior. In the morning, I ordered a bouquet of flowers through the Ele.me delivery platform. What should have been a joyous occasion turned sour when the flowers arrived at my senior&rsquo;s place with an attached card that read &ldquo;To my little Yu baby&rdquo; along with some personal wishes. I had not requested any card to be included.</p>
<p>It seemed the card had been mistakenly attached. Fortunately, I was present when the flowers were delivered, preventing any misunderstandings or conflicts. Although somewhat disappointed, I wasn&rsquo;t overly upset at the time and contacted the merchant for a return.</p>
<p>I explained the situation to the merchant, expressing my understanding that the florist might have attached the wrong card. However, since giving flowers is more about emotional value than the flowers themselves, I no longer wanted this bouquet that seemed &ldquo;intended for someone else.&rdquo; The merchant&rsquo;s attitude, however, was quite rude.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s the wrong card, just throw it away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong, why should I accept a return?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you can contact customer service to protect your rights then.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I consider myself an emotionally stable person who generally treats those around me and the world with kindness. I&rsquo;ve never troubled delivery personnel delayed by bad weather, nor have I ever demanded compensation or refunds from delivery drivers for spilled food. Yet, the merchant&rsquo;s attitude still angered me.</p>
<p>I can understand the florist&rsquo;s oversight and have no complaints about the flowers themselves. What I find lamentable is that the merchant, being in the &ldquo;floral art&rdquo; business, should understand that those who send flowers are not just sending flowers, but conveying sentiments or expressing emotions. Her attitude made me feel that these feelings were not respected.</p>
<p>It seems that for this flower seller, flowers are just flowers, mass-produced artificial objects. The sender&rsquo;s nervousness, the recipient&rsquo;s shyness or surprise all seem irrelevant.</p>
<p>Of course, I understand that as a business, there are cost and revenue considerations. But this still pained the few remnants of idealism I still harbor. Without these emotional underpinnings, even the most beautiful floral art is nothing more than a pile of organic matter that will soon decay.</p>
<h3 id="merchants-and-consumers">Merchants and Consumers</h3>
<p>So I contacted customer service, and after some communication, I learned why the merchant was so unafraid. It turns out that on the Ele.me platform, flowers are non-returnable items. I understand that the original intention might be because flowers are handmade perishable goods that cannot be resold after return.</p>
<p>This reminds me of the recent controversy about consumers abusing Pinduoduo&rsquo;s &ldquo;refund only&rdquo; mechanism to harm merchants. Isn&rsquo;t this experience also an example of merchants using platform rules to harm consumers?</p>
<h3 id="the-ai-ification-of-humans">The AI-ification of Humans</h3>
<p>This matter wasn&rsquo;t over yet, and my conversation with Ele.me&rsquo;s customer service left me even more speechless.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Me: (After describing the situation and the merchant&rsquo;s attitude problem in detail again) I want to request a return, but the merchant refused.</p>
<p>Customer Service: So the flowers themselves are fine, right?</p>
<p>Me: &hellip;If you put it that way, I suppose so, but I don&rsquo;t want them anymore.</p>
<p>Customer Service: According to our platform policy, we can&rsquo;t refund fresh flowers~</p>
<p>Me: But it came with a card for someone else. These aren&rsquo;t the flowers I wanted.</p>
<p>Customer Service: How about I contact the merchant to send you a new card?</p>
<p>Me: &hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m still somewhat bemused by this conversation. People say that since ChatGPT came out, AI has become more and more human-like, and AGI might not be far off. But I feel that before that happens, humans are becoming more and more AI-like. It seems that for them, treating the person on the other end as a thinking, feeling human being has become a difficult task.</p>
<p>Sometimes I often wonder what&rsquo;s wrong with people these days. Those in the business of making fresh flowers don&rsquo;t treat flowers well, nor can they imagine the unpleasant emotions if they received flowers from their loved one with someone else&rsquo;s name on it. Those in the business of solving user problems don&rsquo;t listen properly to what users are saying, only knowing how to reply with templates.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/flower_from_beijing.png" alt="flower_from_beijing"></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m reminded of a florist I used to order from regularly when I was in Beijing. Because it was custom bouquets, they were much more expensive than those on the platform. But she would ask about my story and the emotions I wanted to express, remember our habit of putting flowers in vases, and could realize all sorts of little ideas I had about flowers. At the time, I was just impressed by the florist&rsquo;s attentiveness. Now I realize that speaking properly and doing one&rsquo;s job with care has become something to be coveted in today&rsquo;s society.</p>
<p>It was a small shop, with only the owner handling everything from sourcing, flower selection, arranging, to delivery. This shop I ordered from this time is considered a popular one in Hangzhou, often topping various platform rankings with over 9,000 sales. Bad money drives out good, it&rsquo;s truly sad.</p>

<p>In the article &ldquo;What Changed in My Blog in 2024&rdquo;, I introduced the blog system I built using Serverless platforms and some open-source projects, and also started this series of tutorials to document the entire build and deployment process.</p>
<p>This article is about the solution for the image hosting system.</p>
<p><strong>[2024-07-02 Update]</strong></p>
<p>I wrote a new tutorial implementing privacy and copyright protection for the image hosting system, which can be considered an additional chapter.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h2 id="image-hosting-solution-iterations">Image Hosting Solution Iterations</h2>
<p>At the beginning of setting up my blog, due to the limited content and few illustrations, most of the images were directly placed in the <code>static</code> directory of my Hugo blog repository. I didn&rsquo;t feel any inconvenience until I needed to publish on multiple platforms. After copying the blog&rsquo;s markdown source files, all the images were unable to display because they were using relative paths to the blog. I had to re-upload the images one by one, which was very cumbersome.</p>
<p>It was then that I began to understand the concept of image hosting - uploading images to a dedicated storage service and using them via public links. This not only allows for unified management but also effectively reduces the size of blog repository files and improves the loading speed of the website.</p>
<h3 id="github--jsdelivr-cdn--picgo">GitHub + jsDelivr CDN + PicGo</h3>
<p>Initially, I created a new GitHub repository &ldquo;GitHub - image-hosting&rdquo;, uploaded directly to the repository through PicGo, and changed the image path returned by PicGo to the CDN-accelerated link from <a href="https://www.jsdelivr.com/">jsDelivr</a>. It was quite convenient and even had version control.</p>
<p>However, the good times didn&rsquo;t last long. jsDelivr suffered DNS pollution and was blocked in mainland China, causing my blog images to be completely unloadable for a long period. This made me have some concerns about this purely CDN-dependent approach. Additionally, hosting images on GitHub is based on code repositories, and uploading images relies on code commits, which can easily pollute the commit history. It&rsquo;s ultimately a kind of abuse, and if there are issues with account/repository access, it&rsquo;s easy to lose all the images. So I started looking for other solutions.</p>
<h3 id="aliyun-oss--picgo">Aliyun OSS + PicGo</h3>
<p>The second option that came to mind was object storage provided by cloud service providers. Services like Amazon S3 and Aliyun OSS not only provide publicly accessible links but also offer advantages such as access control, data backup, and scalability. They provide an optimal solution for file data storage and management at a relatively low cost.</p>
<p>As I wanted to optimize access for users in mainland China, I ultimately chose Aliyun OSS. The configuration wasn&rsquo;t complicated, and I still used PicGo for uploading and converting to Aliyun OSS links. There was a noticeable improvement in access speed.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/aliyunoss_invoice.jpeg" alt="aliyunoss_invoice"></p>
<p>However, due to the pay-as-you-go billing model, the continuously growing cost was a consideration for a non-profit personal blog. In early 2023, there was a period when my blog traffic was quite high, and the monthly bills kept increasing. Additionally, if I wanted to use a custom access domain for Aliyun OSS, I needed to go through the filing process. Since my domain is hosted through Cloudflare, I didn&rsquo;t consider filing. So after using it for a few months, I considered changing the image hosting solution again.</p>
<h3 id="chevereto--picgo">Chevereto + PicGo</h3>
<p>After some research, I deployed the free self-hosted version of <a href="https://github.com/rodber/chevereto-free">Chevereto</a> using a Docker image on my Bandwagon server (with good connectivity, CN2GIA DC6 data center), and mounted the images as a Docker Volume on the host.</p>
<p>To be honest, Chevereto&rsquo;s interface style is a bit outdated, still using the old php service. The free version hasn&rsquo;t been maintained or upgraded for a long time, but it&rsquo;s comprehensive in functionality. It can still use PicGo to interface with Chevereto&rsquo;s API for image uploading and other operations, and the stability is good. So I used it for a year and a half.</p>
<p>But I was too careless about the stability of self-hosted services and the preciousness of data. A few days ago, the server suddenly went down, with a kernel error that prevented it from rebooting. The service being down was one thing, but I couldn&rsquo;t export my image data from the past year and a half. I contacted technical support through a ticket, but they only replied twice in a day, once telling me to restart, and once suggesting I hire a network administrator to investigate.</p>
<p>I had to be self-reliant. After searching through various solutions online and struggling for a day, I finally managed to solve it. But this lesson gave me a whole new understanding of the backup and stability of self-hosted services with important data. Additionally, when I wanted to redeploy, I found that the free version images had been taken offline, leaving only a yearly paid License version. So I abandoned the original solution.</p>
<h3 id="cloudflare-r2--webp-cloud--picgo">Cloudflare R2 + WebP Cloud + PicGo</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/cloudflare_r2_free_tier.png" alt="cloudflare_r2_free_tier"></p>
<p>So I turned back to the object storage of cloud service providers and discovered the R2 object storage service provided by the cyber bodhisattva Cloudflare. The free plan includes 10 GB of storage capacity per month, which is completely sufficient for personal use. The services and data security of a large company also provide assurance.</p>
<p>To optimize user access, I also used a &ldquo;WebP Cloud&rdquo; service to proxy the images from R2, further reducing image size at the proxy level. Although the speed for domestic users is certainly not comparable to Aliyun OSS&rsquo;s network, under the comprehensive conditions of no need for filing, stability, and being free, this is the best solution I could think of.</p>
<p>On the computer side, it&rsquo;s still almost one-click upload through the PicGo client and generates markdown image links that can be directly used in the blog. Once configured, it&rsquo;s very smooth to use.</p>
<h2 id="image-hosting-setup-instructions">Image Hosting Setup Instructions</h2>
<p>Although the Cloudflare R2 + WebP Cloud + PicGo solution involves multiple components and platforms, all operations are within the Free Plan. This is the solution I ultimately chose, and below I will introduce how to build this free image hosting system from scratch.</p>
<h3 id="cloudflare-r2">Cloudflare R2</h3>
<p>R2 is a free object storage service launched by Cloudflare. You need to register a free <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/zh-cn/">Cloudflare account</a> to use it. After registering and logging in, click R2 on the left sidebar to access the service. However, it&rsquo;s worth noting that activating the R2 service requires binding a credit card (major domestic and international credit cards are accepted), but no charges will be made. It&rsquo;s mainly used to verify user identity.</p>
<h4 id="creating-an-image-hosting-bucket">Creating an Image Hosting Bucket</h4>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/cloudflare_r2_interview.png" alt="cloudflare_r2_interview"></p>
<p>After activating the R2 service, click the &ldquo;Create bucket&rdquo; button in the top right corner to create a new bucket.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/cloudflare_r2_create_bucket.png" alt="cloudflare_r2_create_bucket"></p>
<p>On the creation configuration page, you need to fill in the bucket name. It&rsquo;s recommended to use something identifiable, as it will be used later when configuring uploads.</p>
<p>For the location, select &ldquo;Automatic&rdquo;, but you can additionally configure a location hint. Since I will be using the &ldquo;WebP Cloud&rdquo; service&rsquo;s US West data center for image proxy optimization later, I chose &ldquo;North America West (WNAM)&rdquo; here. You can choose other regions based on your needs, but Cloudflare doesn&rsquo;t guarantee that you will definitely be allocated to the specified region.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/cloudflare_r2_create_done.png" alt="cloudflare_r2_create_done"></p>
<p>Click the &ldquo;Create bucket&rdquo; button to complete the creation. At this point, we can already upload files to our &ldquo;yu-r2-test&rdquo; bucket. You can choose to upload files or folders directly on the web page.</p>
<p>You can also use the S3 API for uploading. We will rely on this method for uploading using the PicGo client later, but it requires some additional configuration. Click the &ldquo;Settings&rdquo; option in the navigation bar to configure.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/cloudflare_r2_config.png" alt="cloudflare_r2_config"></p>
<p>First, we need to enable the &ldquo;R2.dev subdomain&rdquo;. This is for the public address needed to access the images later. Click &ldquo;Allow access&rdquo; and enter &ldquo;allow&rdquo; as prompted to enable it.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/r2_dev_domain_allow.png" alt="r2_dev_domain_allow"></p>
<p>After completion, a public web address ending with <code>r2.dev</code> will be displayed, which is the address we will use to access images later.</p>
<h4 id="custom-image-hosting-domain-optional">Custom Image Hosting Domain (Optional)</h4>
<p>However, the assigned address is quite long and not easy to remember. We can use a &ldquo;Custom domain&rdquo; to bind our exclusive domain name. Click the &ldquo;Connect domain&rdquo; button.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/r2_custom_domain_setup.png" alt="r2_custom_domain_setup"></p>
<p>Enter the domain name you want to bind, such as <code>yu-r2-test.pseudoyu.com</code>, and click continue.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/cloudflare_r2_custom_domain.png" alt="cloudflare_r2_custom_domain"></p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/r2_custom_domain_dns_wait.png" alt="r2_custom_domain_dns_wait"></p>
<p>Connect the domain and wait for the DNS resolution to take effect.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/r2_bucket_status.png" alt="r2_bucket_status"></p>
<p>After completion, the bucket status should show &ldquo;Allowed&rdquo; for &ldquo;Public URL access&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Domain&rdquo; should display the custom domain name we just set up, indicating successful configuration.</p>
<h4 id="configuring-bucket-access-api">Configuring Bucket Access API</h4>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/yu_bucket_preview.png" alt="yu_bucket_preview"></p>
<p>When we&rsquo;ve completed the above configuration, we can return to the bucket &ldquo;Objects&rdquo; interface, upload a sample image, and click on the details to display the access address for that image. At this point, we have an accessible image hosting service.</p>
<p>However, manually uploading images through the Cloudflare page each time is obviously not convenient enough. R2 provides an S3-compatible API, which allows for easy use of some client/command-line tools for operations such as uploading and deleting.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/create_r2_api_token.png" alt="create_r2_api_token"></p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/create_r2_api_key.png" alt="create_r2_api_key"></p>
<p>Return to the R2 main page, click &ldquo;Manage R2 API Tokens&rdquo; in the top right corner, then click &ldquo;Create API token&rdquo; after entering.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/r2_apikey_conifg.png" alt="r2_apikey_conifg"></p>
<p>Enter a token name, select &ldquo;Object Read and Write&rdquo; for &ldquo;Permissions&rdquo; and assign this API to the previously created Bucket. This minimizes permissions and ensures data security. Other options can be kept as default.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/api_key_config_details.png" alt="api_key_config_details"></p>
<p>After creation is complete, all keys will be displayed. We need the following three pieces of information for PicGo. However, as they will only be shown once, it&rsquo;s advisable to keep these parameter information safe in a password manager or elsewhere.</p>
<p>At this point, we have completed the configuration part on Cloudflare R2. Next, we need to configure the PicGo client.</p>
<h3 id="picgo">PicGo</h3>
<p>PicGo is a tool software for quickly uploading and obtaining image URLs, with a relatively rich plugin ecosystem supporting multiple image hosting services. Its GitHub repository is &ldquo;GitHub - Molunerfinn/PicGo&rdquo;, and you can download the corresponding platform client for use.</p>
<h4 id="configuring-r2-image-hosting">Configuring R2 Image Hosting</h4>
<p>PicGo itself doesn&rsquo;t include S3 image hosting, but it can be supported through the &ldquo;GitHub - wayjam/picgo-plugin-s3&rdquo; plugin.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/picgo_s3_plugin.png" alt="picgo_s3_plugin"></p>
<p>Select to install in &ldquo;Plugin Settings&rdquo;, and a new Amazon S3 option will appear in &ldquo;Image Hosting Settings&rdquo;. Click to enter the configuration options.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/r2_picgo_s3_config.png" alt="r2_picgo_s3_config"></p>
<p>There are several configuration items that need particular attention:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Application Key ID</strong>, fill in the Access Key ID from the R2 API</li>
<li><strong>Application Key</strong>, fill in the Secret Access Key from the R2 API</li>
<li><strong>Bucket Name</strong>, fill in the Bucket name created in R2, such as <code>yu-r2-test</code> in my example above</li>
<li><strong>File Path</strong>, the file path uploaded to R2, I chose to use <code>{fileName}.{extName}</code> to preserve the original file name and extension</li>
<li><strong>Custom Node</strong>, fill in the &ldquo;Jurisdiction-specific endpoint for S3 clients&rdquo; from the R2 API, i.e., the S3 Endpoint in the format <code>xxx.r2.cloudflarestorage.com</code></li>
<li><strong>Custom Domain Name</strong>, fill in the <code>xxx.r2.dev</code> format domain generated earlier or the custom domain name, such as <code>yu-r2-test.pseudoyu.com</code> that I configured</li>
</ul>
<p>Other configurations can be kept as default. After confirming that the parameters are correct, click &ldquo;Confirm&rdquo; and &ldquo;Set as Default Image Hosting&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 id="image-upload">Image Upload</h4>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/upload_r2_with_picgo.png" alt="upload_r2_with_picgo"></p>
<p>After completing the above configuration, we can directly drag files into the &ldquo;Upload Area&rdquo; to upload images. If it displays correctly after upload, the configuration is successful. The generated link will automatically be in the system clipboard, and you can directly paste it where needed.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/picgo_custom_url_format.png" alt="picgo_custom_url_format"></p>
<p>And you can select the corresponding format in the link format, such as URL or Markdown format links that can be used in blogs. Here, I made a small configuration: in the left &ldquo;PicGo Settings&rdquo; - &ldquo;Custom Link Format&rdquo;, I modified it to <code>![$fileName]($url)</code>, and selected &ldquo;Custom&rdquo; in the link format of the upload area. This way, after I upload, it will generate a Markdown image link with the file name as the Alt text based on the file name.</p>
<h3 id="webp-cloud-image-optimization">WebP Cloud Image Optimization</h3>
<p>At this point, we have completed the entire image hosting setup, configuration, and upload process. However, usually, the images we screenshot locally or take with cameras are quite large, which would take a long time for visitors to load and are not directly suitable for internet publishing.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/tiny_png_compress.png" alt="tiny_png_compress"></p>
<p>For a long time, I used a very clumsy method: the API of the online website &ldquo;TinyPNG&rdquo; combined with an open-source macOS client application. I would drag images into it for compression before uploading to the image hosting through PicGo. This usually could reduce the image size by more than 50% with minimal loss in image quality. It was cumbersome but effective.</p>
<p>After changing the image hosting solution this time, I also started looking for more intelligent image optimization services, and thought of &ldquo;WebP Cloud&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I actually learned about this service last year one evening when I was watching people play rhythm games in an arcade in a Hangzhou shopping mall with <a href="https://x.com/strrlthedev">STRRL</a>. He showed me the news that a blog post by <a href="https://x.com/n0vad3v">Nova Kwok</a> had topped the Hacker News rankings, and we spent half an hour looking at it together. At that time, I only knew it was a service for optimizing images, but didn&rsquo;t understand it in detail.</p>
<p>So I opened the official website &ldquo;webp.se&rdquo; again to look at a more detailed introduction.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/webp_se_intro.png" alt="webp_se_intro"></p>
<p>In simple terms, this is a CDN-like image proxy SaaS service that can significantly reduce image size while maintaining almost the same image quality, thus speeding up overall site loading. As it has developed, in addition to reducing image size, it now offers more practical features such as caching, adding watermarks, image filters, and provides custom header configuration options.</p>
<p>After looking around, I felt it could well meet my blog image optimization needs, so I started to tinker with the configuration.</p>
<h4 id="configuring-webp-cloud">Configuring WebP Cloud</h4>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/webp_cloud_login.png" alt="webp_cloud_login"></p>
<p>First, log in to the <a href="https://dashboard.webp.se/">WebP Cloud</a> platform through GitHub authorization.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/webp_cloud_overview.png" alt="webp_cloud_overview"></p>
<p>The page is very intuitive, mainly showing the Free Quota and additional Quota data under the current Plan, as well as some usage statistics.</p>
<p>Click the &ldquo;Create Proxy&rdquo; button to add configuration.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/webp_cloud_config.png" alt="webp_cloud_config"></p>
<ul>
<li>To optimize access for users in China, I chose the US West &ldquo;Hillsboro, OR&rdquo; region for &ldquo;Proxy Region&rdquo;</li>
<li>Fill in a custom name for &ldquo;Proxy Name&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Proxy Origin URL&rdquo; is important, you need to fill in the R2 custom domain name we configured earlier, such as <code>yu-r2-test.pseudoyu.com</code> in my case. If you haven&rsquo;t configured a custom domain name, fill in the <code>xxx.r2.dev</code> format domain provided by R2</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/yu_webp_test.png" alt="yu_webp_test"></p>
<p>The <code>xxx.webp.li</code> format shown under &ldquo;Visitor&rdquo; in the Basic info section of the image is our proxy address.</p>
<p>For example, the file <a href="https://yu-r2-test.pseudoyu.com/new_mbp_setup.jpg">yu-r2-test.pseudoyu.com/new_mbp_setup.jpg</a> we previously uploaded to R2 through PicGo can be accessed using this link: <a href="https://dc84642.webp.li/new_mbp_setup.jpg">dc84642.webp.li/new_mbp_setup.jpg</a>.</p>
<p><del>If you don&rsquo;t like the default proxy address, you can contact the developer through the chat in the bottom right corner or by email to customize the domain name. There might be a more automated configuration process in the future.</del></p>
<p><strong>[2024-07-06 Update]</strong></p>
<p>Custom domain configuration is now supported. For detailed instructions, please refer to &ldquo;Custom Domain | WebP Cloud Services Docs&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 id="changing-picgo-configuration">Changing PicGo Configuration</h4>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/change_pic_go_config.png" alt="change_pic_go_config"></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that since the images we ultimately need to place in the blog are links that have been proxied through WebP Cloud, we need to return to PicGo&rsquo;s &ldquo;Image Hosting Settings&rdquo; and change the &ldquo;Custom Domain&rdquo; to the WebP Cloud proxy address we just configured, which is in the format <code>xxx.webp.li</code> or other custom domain names.</p>
<h4 id="webp-cloud-usage">WebP Cloud Usage</h4>
<p>Free users have 2000 Free Quota per day, meaning they can proxy 2000 image access requests, and provide 100M of image cache. This is completely sufficient for general users. If there are some specific periods with higher traffic, you can also purchase additional Quota, which is very cheap.</p>
<p>If the Quota is exceeded, access will be 301 redirected to the source image address, without compression by the WebP Cloud service, but it will still be usable. If the cache exceeds 100M, it will be cleared according to the LRU algorithm, so it can still ensure that some high-frequency requested images can have a good access experience.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/yu_webp_uasge.png" alt="yu_webp_uasge"></p>
<p>My blog&rsquo;s daily visits are around 300-500 visits. Adding some RSS subscriptions and crawler traffic, according to WebP Cloud statistics, the daily requests are about 4000-5000, with 10000+ on days when I publish new posts.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/webp_cloud_price.png" alt="webp_cloud_price"></p>
<p>So for now, I&rsquo;ve chosen the Lite plan, combined with some additional usage to cover peak traffic. I plan to observe for a while longer to see how it goes.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The above is my image hosting system setup solution. All the images in this article were also uploaded using PicGo, stored in Cloudflare R2, and optimized through WebP Cloud proxy.</p>
<p>This is one of my blog setup and deployment series tutorials. If you&rsquo;re interested in setting up comment systems, data statistics systems, etc., please stay tuned. I hope this can be of reference to everyone.</p>

<p>Two years ago, in the post <a href="https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2022/06/12/why_i_still_write_blog_in_2022/">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s 2022, Let&rsquo;s Talk About Why I&rsquo;m Still Blogging&rdquo;</a>, I discussed the origins, intentions, and setup of my blog.</p>
<p>More than two years have passed. The original intention remains, and the writing has persevered, though I haven&rsquo;t achieved the weekly updates I planned. Nevertheless, I&rsquo;ve accumulated a fair amount of written work.</p>
<p>Having experienced much, I seem to have gradually transformed into a &ldquo;weekly review blogger,&rdquo; with content and style that have greatly changed. There are fewer posts about technology and productivity tools, and more sharing of life and reflections. Gone are the days of staying up for two nights to update four technical tutorials; instead, there&rsquo;s a sense of self-reconciliation after expressing emotions through writing. I still feel happy receiving thanks for blog setup and technical tutorials, but I cherish even more the heartfelt exchanges with strangers.</p>
<h2 id="weekly-review-blogger">Weekly Review Blogger</h2>
<p>Perhaps it was during a casual meeting discussion about xLog&rsquo;s future development when a colleague suddenly cued me, asking what thoughts I had as a &ldquo;weekly review blogger.&rdquo; I was taken aback, hearing this title for the first time. Scrolling through my homepage, indeed, it fit.</p>
<p>I used to consider myself a tech blogger, a productivity tool blogger, but in the end, the content that remained the most, leaving the deepest impression on everyone, seems to be the weekly reviews. Not bad.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/weekly_review_group_chat.png" alt="weekly_review_group_chat"></p>
<p>The start of writing weekly reviews seems to have been when &ldquo;Homura&rdquo; organized a weekly review supervision group. At that time, I was still a nobody in both Twitter and independent blogging circles, hoping for more group support and communication. I would throw my weekly review into the group, sometimes feeling motivated by others, sometimes concerned about others&rsquo; life states. It was a happy time.</p>
<p>Later, everyone experienced many changes in life and work. The last message in the group stayed at January 2023, but that remains a very happy period for me. It&rsquo;s also the motivation for me to continue writing weekly reviews because I know that even if I&rsquo;m only sharing the trivialities of life and some immature little ideas, there are still people reading my words carefully.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/weekly_view_discuss_with_randy.png" alt="weekly_view_discuss_with_randy"></p>
<p>Previously, I received an update reminder from Randy. He said there&rsquo;s no need to define it as a weekly review, as it often brings pressure and constraints. However, I rely on this output-driven input mode. With the weekly review as a result-oriented goal, I have more motivation to live the week well.</p>
<p><del>Although I often redefine what a week is.</del></p>
<h2 id="independent-blogging">Independent Blogging</h2>
<p>Compared to beautifully arranged books and magazines, I enjoy visiting others&rsquo; blog websites more. The site name, theme color, music arrangement all more authentically present a personalized existence. When reading blog posts, I often view it as a dialogue across time and space, imagining the author&rsquo;s mood when writing these word fragments. Sometimes I even playfully imagine what kind of person they are and what they might be doing at this moment.</p>
<p>Independent blogging is actually a circle that&rsquo;s neither big nor small. Two years have passed, and I feel that more people are starting to set up blogs and write blogs, and there&rsquo;s more interesting, high-quality content.</p>
<p>Compared to other mature content platforms that are more convenient for accumulating fans and interaction, it&rsquo;s not just independence in terms of platform and writing form (I&rsquo;m actually willing to call those who share content seriously on Mastodon or Misskey independent bloggers), but independence of thought. Good articles not only impart knowledge but also provoke thought.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/dubo_1_intro.png" alt="dubo_1_intro"></p>
<p>I also chatted with Randy about wanting to do something for independent blogging, like compiling good articles read during a period of time in the form of a periodical and writing a preface to recommend them. Actually, the first issue has been prepared, but due to the busy schedules of both of us and a more focused effort on the EpubKit product, it hasn&rsquo;t been released yet. This is also something I hope to continue doing at some point in the future.</p>
<h2 id="blog-system">Blog System</h2>
<p>These are a few articles I wrote about blog setup two years ago:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2022/06/12/why_i_still_write_blog_in_2022/">It&rsquo;s 2022, Let&rsquo;s Talk About Why I&rsquo;m Still Blogging</a></li>

</ul>
<p>These mainly revolved around my records of using Hugo, a static website generator (SSG), to build a personal blog and some peripheral services. I&rsquo;ve also seen many people contact me saying they successfully have their own blogs following this series of tutorials. I&rsquo;m very happy to make a small contribution to blogging, a form of creation that has somewhat declined.</p>
<p>I was very satisfied with my entire set of solutions when I wrote them, but looking back after two years.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blog Body</strong>: Hugo itself hasn&rsquo;t changed, deployment solution: GitHub Pages + Cloudflare CDN -&gt; Cloudflare Pages</li>
<li><strong>Comment System</strong>: Cusdis -&gt; Remark42, deployment platform: Railway -&gt; Vercel + Supabase -&gt; fly.io</li>
<li><strong>Statistics System</strong>: Umami -&gt; goatcounter, deployment platform: Vercel + Heroku -&gt; Railway -&gt; Netlify + Supabase -&gt; fly.io</li>
<li><strong>Image Hosting System</strong>: GitHub + jsDelivr -&gt; Alibaba Cloud OSS -&gt; Self-hosted Chevereto on VPS + PicGo -&gt; Cloudflare R2 + WebP Cloud + PicGo</li>
<li><strong>Content Search</strong>: None -&gt; Pagefind static search</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many reasons for the changes. Some are due to Heroku and Railway gradually canceling their free plans, some are due to open-source projects updating less and lacking features, and some are simply because I wanted to tinker around to make things lighter.</p>
<p>I remember when I wrote this series of tutorials, it was mainly because I felt that the solutions and tutorials that could be found online were scattered and often outdated. So I wanted to provide a one-stop solution for readers who wanted to set up a blog. After publication, I received feedback from many people. Some content should have been updated long ago, but I&rsquo;ve been putting it off until now to start rewriting, which I feel quite ashamed about.</p>
<p>The following text will introduce the current solution, and links to the updated series of articles will be added later when completed.</p>
<h3 id="blog-body">Blog Body</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/yu_blog_homepage_20240629.png" alt="yu_blog_homepage_20240629"></p>
<p>I use <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, this static website generator, to build my personal blog, using and modifying a rather retro theme &ldquo;hugo-theme-den&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The general process can be referred to in the article <a href="https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2022/05/29/deploy_your_blog_using_hugo_and_github_action/">&ldquo;Hugo + GitHub Action, Build Your Blog Automatic Publishing System&rdquo;</a> and the repository <a href="https://github.com/pseudoyu/yu-blog">&ldquo;GitHub - yu-blog&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>I added some GitHub Actions automated operations to update the About page daily, and because websites hosted on GitHub Pages became almost inaccessible from within China, I migrated to Cloudflare Pages, which is free and provides a much better experience. There haven&rsquo;t been many other changes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that I haven&rsquo;t thought about changing frameworks. I was quite envious when I saw &ldquo;Owen&rdquo; and &ldquo;PJ Wu&rdquo; using <a href="https://www.getzola.org/">Zola</a>, and I even thought about writing one myself like &ldquo;Goidea&rdquo; or &ldquo;Innei&rdquo;.</p>
<p>But when I calmed down and thought about it, I&rsquo;ve accumulated quite a few articles on my current website, and if I wanted to keep the original paths, it would inevitably involve a lot of tinkering. Plus, I really like the current theme, so I might as well just customize and modify the theme directly if I have any ideas. It&rsquo;s better to spend less effort on tinkering with platforms and write more blog posts, otherwise it might be a bit like valuing the casket over the jewels, so I gave up on the idea.</p>
<h3 id="comment-system">Comment System</h3>
<p>From the inception of the blog until April or May this year, I had been using <a href="https://cusdis.com/">Cusdis</a> consistently for three years.</p>
<p>To this day, it&rsquo;s still a highly recommendable solution - lightweight, easy to self-deploy, and with a simple and attractive style. For setup instructions, refer to <a href="https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2022/05/24/free_and_lightweight_blog_comment_system_using_cusdis_and_railway/">&ldquo;Lightweight Open Source Free Blog Comment System Solution (Cusdis + Railway)&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>However, given that Railway has canceled its Free Plan since August last year, if you still want to use it completely free, you can use Vercel/Netlify/Zeabur to deploy the main project for free, and deploy a free PostgreSQL database instance on <a href="https://supabase.com">Supabase</a>, passing the link as an environment variable into the Cusdis service. The rest of the process is largely similar.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/yu_remark42_preview.png" alt="yu_remark42_preview"></p>
<p>Recently, due to a persistent Vercel deployment error when changing the database URI, plus the need for some new features, I finally decided to migrate from Cusdis. After researching for a while, I chose <a href="https://remark42.com/">Remark42</a>, which was ultimately selected by <a href="https://reorx.com/">reorx</a> in his article <a href="https://reorx.com/blog/blog-commenting-systems/">&ldquo;Changing Blog Comment Systems&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>In terms of configuration options alone, it&rsquo;s quite a bit richer than Cusdis. Currently, I&rsquo;ve configured several common social account logins (GitHub, Twitter, Telegram, email), anonymous commenting is supported, email subscription for reply notifications is available, and I&rsquo;ve also set up TG bot notifications. It&rsquo;s deployed on <a href="https://fly.io/">fly.io</a>, with a single Go binary + single file database, a very comfortable solution. I&rsquo;ll update the tutorial link here once the blog post is completed.</p>
<p><strong>[2024-07-22 Update]</strong></p>
<p>For details on setting up the comment system, see this post:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2024/07/22/free_commenting_system_using_remark42_and_flyio/">Build Your Free Blog Comment System from Scratch (Remark42 + fly.io)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="data-statistics-system">Data Statistics System</h3>
<p>I previously self-deployed Umami (refer to the tutorial <a href="https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2022/05/21/free_blog_analysis_using_umami_vercel_and_heroku/">&ldquo;Build a Free Personal Blog Data Analysis System from Scratch (umami + Vercel + Heroku)&rdquo;</a>), but later, due to Heroku canceling its free Plan, I tinkered around and chose to deploy the service on Netlify + deploy a PostgreSQL database instance on Supabase. The rest of the process remains applicable.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/yu_goatcounter_preview.png" alt="yu_goatcounter_preview"></p>
<p>However, on one hand, because I deployed it quite early, there was a major version that couldn&rsquo;t be upgraded, causing me to stay on an old version I forked. On the other hand, I gradually felt that this kind of service and database separation inevitably led to frequent migrations due to platform rule changes, which felt a bit too heavy. So finally, I switched to <a href="https://www.goatcounter.com/">goatcounter</a>, which is also deployed on <a href="https://fly.io/">fly.io</a> with a single Go binary + SQLite database file, another very comfortable deployment solution. I&rsquo;ll update the tutorial link here once the blog post is updated.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/yu_google_console_preview.png" alt="yu_google_console_preview"></p>
<p>Additionally, I still use <a href="https://search.google.com/search-console">Google Console</a> to analyze and statistics my visitor information and search weight.</p>
<p>These results are quite informative. I found that an article comparing terminals <a href="https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2022/07/10/my_config_and_beautify_solution_of_macos_terminal/">&ldquo;Warp, iTerm2, or Alacritty? My Terminal Tinkering Notes&rdquo;</a> continuously brings me visitors through search engines. The other popular articles are the series about personal blogs and setup.</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="image-hosting-system">Image Hosting System</h3>
<p>Two years ago, I hadn&rsquo;t really paid much attention to the issue of image hosting. All images were directly thrown into the GitHub repository and used jsDelivr as a CDN for acceleration (which later became almost inaccessible from within China). However, as the number of articles increased, friends often told me that they couldn&rsquo;t load the images on my blog. Thinking about improving the reading experience, I researched various solutions.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/aliyunoss_invoice.jpeg" alt="aliyunoss_invoice"></p>
<p>I first chose Alibaba Cloud OSS for image storage, using PicGo for uploading on the computer. The solution was quite good, and there were no problems for the first few months, until early 2023 when a few articles had relatively high traffic. Seeing the upward trend of the monthly bill, I suddenly felt poor.</p>
<p>So I set up a Chevereto image hosting on a Bandwagon server with good connectivity, still using PicGo&rsquo;s plugin for uploading. It was used steadily for a year and a half. But I was a bit careless about the stability of self-hosted services and the preciousness of data. A few days ago, the server suddenly went down, with a kernel error that prevented rebooting. The service being down was one thing, but I had no backup of my year and a half of data and couldn&rsquo;t export it.</p>
<p>I contacted technical support through a work order, but they only replied twice in a day, once telling me to restart, and once suggesting I hire a network administrator to investigate. I could only rely on myself. After scouring the internet for various solutions and tinkering for a day, I finally managed to solve it. But this lesson gave me a whole new understanding of the importance of services with critical data and the stability of self-hosting, so I dared not use the original solution anymore.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/yu_webp.png" alt="yu_webp"></p>
<p>Finally, I adopted <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/developer-platform/r2/">Cloudflare R2</a> object storage to store images. The 10GB free quota per month is more than enough, and the service and data security of a big company are also guaranteed. To optimize user access, I also used a &ldquo;WebP Cloud&rdquo; service to proxy the images in R2, further reducing image size at the proxy level. Although the speed for domestic users is certainly not comparable to Alibaba Cloud OSS in terms of connectivity, under the comprehensive conditions of not requiring filing, stability, and being free, this is the best solution I could think of.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/yu_picgo_pics.png" alt="yu_picgo_pics"></p>
<p>On the desktop, I can almost one-click upload through the PicGo client and generate markdown image links directly usable for the blog. After configuration, it&rsquo;s very smooth to use.</p>
<p>For the image hosting setup tutorial, see this post:</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>[2024-07-02 Update]</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written a new tutorial on implementing privacy and copyright protection for image hosting, which can be considered a bonus chapter.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2024/07/02/protect_your_image_using_webp_and_cloudflare_waf/">Adding Privacy and Copyright Protection to Your Image Hosting Using WebP and Cloudflare WAF</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="content-search">Content Search</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/search_in_my_blog.png" alt="search_in_my_blog"></p>
<p>Previously, my blog didn&rsquo;t have a content search function. Initially, there weren&rsquo;t many articles, and since it&rsquo;s a static blog without a backend, it seemed difficult to implement. So I never supported it. But as I sometimes needed to refer to my previous articles and could only search through a bunch of markdown files using VS Code, I felt it was quite necessary.</p>
<p>After researching, I used <a href="https://pagefind.app/">Pagefind</a>, a search library based on static files. It doesn&rsquo;t require introducing or hosting other backend services. I only need to build an index file for the entire blog in the CI every time I publish a blog post, and it can easily support searching. The Chinese search effect is relatively weak, but it&rsquo;s sufficient. It basically supports most mainstream blog frameworks.</p>
<p>This part can be referenced from the article <a href="https://pinchlime.com/blog/how-to-add-a-search-function-to-zola-generated-static-websites-via-pagefind/">&ldquo;How to Add a Search Function to Zola-Generated Static Websites via Pagefind&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In 2024, I&rsquo;m still largely a person who loves writing, from book and movie reviews, technical tutorials in earlier years to current life weekly reviews. It seems that what I see and think only becomes tangible reality when put into words. And with the accumulation of hundreds of articles, my personal blog site has become another carrier of me in this world, originating from me yet independent of me. Sometimes it&rsquo;s a memory fragment that can be picked up at will, sometimes it&rsquo;s a spiritual sanctuary for myself.</p>
<p>I also hope that you can continue to discover some interesting things in my blog, be it knowledge, inspiration, or a little bit of resonance. Perhaps at some moment, you too will want to have your own blog site, to leave some traces of your thoughts in this world, to take root and sprout. I hope this series of tutorials can provide some help.</p>

<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/weekly_review_20240623.png" alt="weekly_review_20240623"></p>
<p>This piece is a record and reflection of my life from <code>June 17, 2024</code> to <code>June 23, 2024</code>.</p>
<p>I went to Hong Kong to attend the Google AI+Web3 event and met many colleagues from my team in person; experienced sleeping in an internet cafe due to not being able to book a room; decided to adjust my life rhythm according to the 5am Club philosophy; started learning Rust for the second time; and many other interesting things happened.</p>
<h2 id="hong-kong-trip">Hong Kong Trip</h2>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/henry_and_kate_at_google.jpg" alt="henry_and_kate_at_google"></p>
<p>The most interesting thing this week was going to Hong Kong to attend Google&rsquo;s Web+AI event. Our project had some talks and roundtable discussions there, and I also had the opportunity to visit Google&rsquo;s Hong Kong office (and got some souvenirs). After working remotely, it&rsquo;s actually quite rare to have the chance to meet colleagues face-to-face. For this event, everyone in our group gathered in Hong Kong, except for one colleague in the United States who couldn&rsquo;t make it. We had dinner together, played Texas Hold&rsquo;em, and even continued with a stroll in Shenzhen afterwards.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/stay_netbar.jpg" alt="stay_netbar"></p>
<p>Interestingly, because my colleague Ares from Hangzhou and I didn&rsquo;t book a room in advance, we were still looking for a hotel around Times Square in Causeway Bay after midnight. We ended up choosing to stay overnight at an internet cafe. Fortunately, we had pillows from Google, which made it quite comfortable to sleep.</p>
<p>It suddenly reminded me of the experience of rushing to submit course projects before deadlines when I was studying in Hong Kong, and then buying a bunch of snacks and beer with my group members to chat by Victoria Harbour and watch the sunrise. I also recalled following the Pokémon GO map to unlock various attractions when traveling to Thailand with friends, and asking a taxi driver in Qingdao to drive around randomly, taking me to interesting places. These are all fascinating life experiences.</p>
<p>Although I&rsquo;m a planner who usually makes meticulous plans, I also very much enjoy this randomness in life. Perhaps years later, I won&rsquo;t remember what interesting speeches were given at this Google talk, but I&rsquo;ll certainly never forget the memory of spending a night in an internet cafe.</p>
<h2 id="5am-club-plan">5am Club Plan</h2>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/hangzhou_night.jpg" alt="hangzhou_night"></p>
<p>Robin Sharma has a book called &ldquo;The 5am Club,&rdquo; which proposes the concept of waking up at five in the morning to engage in self-improvement learning and exercise to achieve the best state. Although for someone like me who often stays up until three or four in the morning or even later, it might be easier to sleep at 5am, I still long for this new lifestyle.</p>
<p>I had a long period of extreme self-discipline in college, sleeping at one or two and waking up at six or seven, seemingly with endless energy and time. During my postgraduate studies in Hong Kong, due to the anxiety of changing majors and academic pressure, I would wake up at six every day to secure a seat in the library, only returning to my rented room close to 11 pm, repeating this cycle day after day, yet finding joy in it.</p>
<p>But perhaps because much of the daytime is naturally occupied after starting work, this habit was quickly broken. To have more complete time for myself, I started sleeping later, but also waking up later. There were periods when I maintained a good state, but it was also easy to fall into some bad cycles: poor study state at night -&gt; anxiety -&gt; revenge bedtime procrastination -&gt; waking up even later the next day -&gt; low efficiency during the day -&gt; even worse study state at night.</p>
<p>So I want to try and challenge myself starting this week. It doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have to be strictly five o&rsquo;clock, just relatively earlier, shifting the late-night study time to the morning, adjusting to start work around 11 am.</p>
<p>Being motivated by the study vlogs of my neighbor &ldquo;polebug&rdquo;, I also gained some motivation to try new fields. So I&rsquo;ve set myself some more interesting goals. The first thing I learn in the morning is something not directly related to work but that I&rsquo;ve always wanted to experience, such as SwiftUI, Rust, and using langchain for some AI application development practices. This time I also plan to learn by getting hands dirty, directly starting some side projects or contributing PRs to open-source projects.</p>
<h2 id="learning-rust">Learning Rust</h2>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/rust_bag_2023.jpg" alt="rust_bag_2023"></p>
<p>As mentioned above, I plan to start learning Rust for the second time. The last time I started was in 2022, and I actually learned quite seriously for a while, following along and writing some demo projects, and even made study notes &ldquo;pseudoyu/learn-rust&rdquo;. However, there was indeed no application scenario in my work, so I&rsquo;ve pretty much forgotten it all.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a Rust enthusiast named Kally in our group who kept recommending it throughout our trips to Hong Kong and Shenzhen. He even made me download an introductory video from YouTube before I boarded the plane, which was indeed quite sleep-inducing.</p>
<p>However, I&rsquo;m seriously planning to relearn it and start writing some of my own projects. Currently, my idea is to rewrite a Go project that uses RSSHub to subscribe to multiple platform information sources in Rust, and see if there are any interesting open-source projects to participate in.</p>
<p>At present, I&rsquo;m watching some basic videos from YouTube channels recommended by Kally, as well as &ldquo;Rust Programming First Course&rdquo; from Geek Time that I bought a long time ago. Rust, let&rsquo;s go!</p>
<h2 id="telegram-channel-1000-subscribers">Telegram Channel 1000 Subscribers</h2>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/channel_1000_subscribers.jpg" alt="channel_1000_subscribers"></p>
<p>My <a href="https://t.me/pseudoyulife">channel</a> has reached 1000 subscribers! I feel like I&rsquo;m expressing less and less on Twitter or other platforms, and prefer to ramble in the channel.</p>
<p>Actually, the desire to share has always been there. Sometimes it&rsquo;s a dialogue with myself, sometimes it&rsquo;s staying up late talking with people around me, and more often, it&rsquo;s wanting to share with more people to get some feedback. However, as someone who has closed their WeChat Moments, I seem to have become unaccustomed to sharing these things with those around me. So for a long time, Twitter became this outlet. And this year, the readers of my blog and the followers of my channel have slowly become the objects of sharing. I feel that under the current rhythm, it seems that listening to people carefully, thinking, and responding has become a precious thing, and I often remind myself not to forget this point.</p>
<p>Thank you all for listening to me carefully.</p>

<p>I put the newly received Google Cloud sticker on my MBP. Collection completed!</p>
<p>In the middle of the week, I discovered a paranormal event with my Mac. When software like Slack/Zoom opened the microphone, the cursor would go out of control, clicking the menu bar in the upper left corner at a frequency of 2-3 seconds, as if it was being remotely controlled. At other times, everything was normal. I went to Apple and spent quite a while with a tech support guy to locate that it was caused by the newly installed Bartender alternative, iBar. According to the comments section, Barbee also has this problem. You can refer to this if you encounter similar issues.</p>
<p>The tech guy said my reproduction, troubleshooting ideas, and operation proficiency were good enough to work there. Apple users are indeed adaptable.</p>
<p>Adding to the fact that one of my computers recently had its screen damaged by our other little cat, Fanfan, at home, I decided to spend a fortune to buy an Apple Care for my MBP14, which just passed its one-year anniversary on July 3rd. The Apple guy told me that if you buy it within a year, you can extend it for three more years on this basis, which seems very cost-effective, equivalent to an extra year!</p>

<p>This piece is a record and reflection of my life from June 7, 2024, to June 16, 2024.</p>
<h2 id="a-good-friends-wedding">A Good Friend&rsquo;s Wedding</h2>
<p>I returned to Beijing during the Dragon Boat Festival to attend a wedding - that of my dear high school friend, Jian.</p>
<p>In high school, I was in the liberal arts class with only eight boys. One of them had a sudden epiphany in the second year of high school, deciding to take a break from school to write books and revitalize Chinese literature, leaving only seven of us to accompany each other through the third year. Perhaps due to our small number, we developed a sense of camaraderie and mutual appreciation. After graduation, we maintained a frequency of two or three gatherings a year until the outbreak of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Among us, three, including myself, were particularly close due to our similar wavelengths. We had a small group chat for daily casual conversations, and we would seize opportunities to meet for meals when traveling to Beijing, Shanghai, or Hangzhou for work. We also visited each other&rsquo;s homes, tasted each other&rsquo;s cooking, and met the people important to each of us.</p>
<p>Last year, another member of our trio was the first to get married. At that time, I wasn&rsquo;t quite &ldquo;up to par&rdquo; with my long blue hair and didn&rsquo;t get to be a groomsman, which left me with a tinge of regret. When Jian set the date for his wedding, he invited me early on to be his groomsman - the only one, in fact. The English term &ldquo;best man&rdquo; is quite an appealing title, and I was both surprised and honored.</p>
<p>In fact, beyond the obligatory duties at the wedding ceremony, I think inviting important people to witness a significant milestone in one&rsquo;s life is inherently romantic.</p>
<p>I spent an afternoon trying on suits a few days before the wedding, only to discover that I couldn&rsquo;t quite pull off the look. In the end, I pieced together a casual suit from my usual men&rsquo;s clothing online store. It was the most formal outfit I&rsquo;ve ever worn. I couldn&rsquo;t bring myself to cut my hair short, but I did trim it and styled it in a more grown-up manner.</p>
<p>It was a lawn wedding, something I&rsquo;ve seen many times in movies but never attended in real life. It was full of ceremony yet intimate. Having been involved in the wedding preparations early on, I could better appreciate the details and thoughtfulness behind this perfect ceremony.</p>
<p>The bridesmaid on the bride&rsquo;s side was an extrovert, radiating with energy, while I was still lowering my head and silently rehearsing the order of hands for presenting the wedding rings just before going on stage. My introversion stood out in stark contrast. It was an interesting juxtaposition, and I&rsquo;m looking forward to seeing the official photos later.</p>
<h2 id="weddings-and-marriage">Weddings and Marriage</h2>
<p>As early as mid-May, I had accompanied them to discuss details with the wedding planning company. Looking at the lengthy and meticulous process charts, item lists, and layout diagrams, I was amazed at the complexity and expense of a wedding. When discussing the quote, we saw that two floral arches and some floral decorations on the seats added up to over 50,000 yuan. So much so that when my senior and I arrived at the wedding venue and saw the floral arches, we couldn&rsquo;t help but think of these numbers.</p>
<p>Weddings are often labeled as &ldquo;once in a lifetime&rdquo; events, so it seems that no amount of effort or expense is too much for that moment of perfection. But I often wonder, when something originally emotional and romantic becomes an endless list of items in an Excel spreadsheet with precise numbers behind it, when every move of the bride and groom must be perfectly prescribed, who is this wedding really for?</p>
<p>Perhaps because my senior and I are people who value experience over form, we might feel that planning and filming a documentary about marriage and love together, taking a &ldquo;tour&rdquo; to see important but long-unseen friends of both sides while wearing a veil and carrying blessings, or capturing some more authentic and precious promises in a church in a favorite country or city would be more memorable than the luxury of a wedding banquet.</p>
<p>But standing beside the groom and witnessing the vows and emotions at the wedding, I felt that perhaps any way is fine, as long as it&rsquo;s with the right person.</p>

<h3 id="blog-comments">Blog Comments</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/ququ_comments.jpg" alt="ququ_comments"></p>
<p>When I discovered that QuQu, a respected figure who had been in my RSS reader subscription list since the early days, was reading my weekly review and even left a comment, I felt like I had successfully met an idol and broken through a dimensional wall 😭</p>
<h3 id="companionship-of-readers">Companionship of Readers</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/atlas_book.jpg" alt="atlas_book"></p>
<p>On my birthday, I initiated a lucky draw, selecting six readers who left comments. Three winners chose EpubKit memberships, two chose physical books, and one chose WeChat Reading.</p>
<p>Interestingly, one of the winning friends reciprocated by sending me a set of voluminous books. Last year, he commented on my birthday summary article &ldquo;The Man Who Pushes Rocks,&rdquo; suggesting that perhaps Sisyphus should also shrug. Today, seeing &ldquo;Atlas Shrugged&rdquo; that he sent me, I felt a strange and warm sense of companionship and connection 🥰.</p>
<h3 id="changing-note-taking-system">Changing Note-taking System</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/change_to_obsidian.jpg" alt="change_to_obsidian"></p>
<p>I spent an afternoon organizing my notes today and realized that Logseq had, to some extent, changed my thinking habits. Although the Daily Notes method indeed reduced the mental burden of recording, it also made my thinking less continuous. My thoughts were all converted into bullet points, yet often couldn&rsquo;t be connected into a complete blog post, and much of what I had learned was gradually forgotten.</p>
<p>So I made up my mind to switch to Obsidian. I didn&rsquo;t install any plugins, but instead adopted a more primitive single-text mode of recording, using files starting with &ldquo;20240615 + keyword&rdquo; and noting tags at the beginning of each article. This actually allows me to organize things more systematically.</p>

<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/dark_desktop.jpg" alt="dark_desktop"></p>
<p>I discovered a <a href="https://www.darkosicon.com/">complete theme set</a> of pure dark icons + wallpaper, which has a very immersive effect (except for the Finder icon which can&rsquo;t be changed and stands out). The practical effect is shown in the image.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s June 6, 2024, and I&rsquo;m 27 years old.</p>
<p>The idea for the weekly review was born on my birthday two years ago. As I mentioned in last year&rsquo;s summary, this is a column and ritual I want to keep up, and it has arrived as promised.</p>
<p>In the first year, I wrote 40 weekly reviews, but last year there were only 20. What decreased wasn&rsquo;t just the quantity, but also my reflections, emotions, and desire for expression. I often say that the weekly review is a vessel for my life and expression, and when my life is in disarray, it&rsquo;s impossible to write anything meaningful. But it seems that there were far too many such &ldquo;bad state&rdquo; moments this year, or to put it another way, I was too indulgent with myself in this state, which is frightening.</p>
<p>I originally thought that the years after growing up wouldn&rsquo;t have as many changes as right after graduation, and I was even prepared to accept that life would eventually settle into tranquility. But standing here now, looking back on this entire year, many things still happened.</p>
<h2 id="the-moon-and-sixpence">The Moon and Sixpence</h2>
<p>For a period of time, my senior would squeeze out time on weekday afternoons to go to the art studio to paint. For several consecutive days, she encountered two students chatting and painting in a focused yet relaxed manner. Feeling a bit envious, she asked them what the secret was to being able to paint freely on weekday afternoons. One of them shrugged and said, &ldquo;Just endure poverty, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seems that people can&rsquo;t look up at the moon while picking up coins at the same time.</p>
<p>But perhaps because I&rsquo;ve been fortunate enough to be protected by those around me as I grew up, I&rsquo;ve always been an idealistic person. What I&rsquo;ve always pursued doesn&rsquo;t seem to be job titles or income, but rather an environment and atmosphere that allows me to continue doing what I love, and a group of like-minded companions with whom I can grow together sincerely.</p>
<p>I also despise the so-called workplace culture. In my previous job, I would directly express my dissatisfaction at company-wide meetings about unreasonable client demands and project managers who were adept at shirking responsibility, rather than being &ldquo;smooth&rdquo;. Many &ldquo;experienced&rdquo; seniors and friends often remind me after our chats to have some sense of caution or to let go of these impractical obsessions, advising me to grab those more tangible, visible benefits early on. I understand, and I know it&rsquo;s useful, but I can&rsquo;t convince myself to do it.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/rss3_2024_annual.jpg" alt="rss3_2024_annual"></p>
<p>Fortunately, everything I pursue can be found everywhere in RSS3, in my current team.</p>
<p>Shortly after my birthday last year, I successfully passed the probation review here. As mentioned in a previous article &ldquo;<a href="https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2024/04/30/weekly_review_20230430/">Weekly Review #58 - A Year of Remote Work</a>&rdquo;, work itself has had its busy and leisurely times, with ups and downs. A year has passed unknowingly, and I look forward to going further together.</p>
<h2 id="the-little-prince-and-his-rose">The Little Prince and His Rose</h2>
<p>Also shortly after my birthday last year, I fell in love (see &ldquo;<a href="https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2023/07/10/weekly_review_20230710/">Weekly Review #43 - In the Mood for Love</a>&rdquo;), and it&rsquo;s been a year now. Just like the Little Prince and his rose, we&rsquo;ve invested time in each other, making each other more important.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/rss3_huddle_share.png" alt="rss3_huddle_share"></p>
<p>A few days ago, there was an internal sharing session at the company. Instead of choosing topics I&rsquo;m more proficient in, like tool usage or writing experience, I shared a more personal topic - dating an older woman. Only then did I realize that everything related to her seems to be the source of my desire to share.</p>
<p>This year, we&rsquo;ve been to many places together. We&rsquo;ve seen the waves in Bali, ridden camels in the Inner Mongolia desert, danced at a beer festival in Beijing, soaked in mountain spring water in Tangshan, Nanjing, run barefoot laughing on the beach in Aranya, and strolled slowly by the small river in Hangzhou. We&rsquo;ve learned many things together: getting up at six or seven on frigid winter mornings for private lessons, our first time learning boxing, our first time painting with oils, our first time surfing&hellip;</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;ve experienced this year is just like what&rsquo;s described in a poem by Rumi that I really like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The questions I ask are all about you,</p>
<p>Every step I take points towards you.</p>
<p>You are everywhere,</p>
<p>In every sound I hear, in every sight I see.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="growing-up-is-a-dispiriting-affair">Growing Up is a Dispiriting Affair</h2>
<p>From a worldly perspective, everything seems to be progressing smoothly. Work, romance, and life - these major themes assigned to humans - all seem to be proceeding according to plan, even too smoothly. As members of society and family, we also seem to be fulfilling our responsibilities. As people grow older, they seem to become gentler towards the world, yet more neglectful of themselves.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in Kernel Panic.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This has been my WeChat signature for a very long time. It&rsquo;s a warning to myself, and the cause of panic still exists today. There are still many things in life that don&rsquo;t go as wished, and whether looking inward or seeking outward, I&rsquo;m still far from my ideal self. But it seems I&rsquo;ve already reconciled with this world, or rather, compromised, giving way to more mundane and concrete things in life, like family affection and social interactions.</p>
<p>When we were in Inner Mongolia for several days, drinking and feasting with various relatives, we both started to miss our former selves from a few years ago. Back then, we both had so much time to read the books we wanted to read, learn the things we wanted to learn, and become the people we wanted to become, instead of being confined here as symbols of society and family. Now, what we seek hasn&rsquo;t changed - my senior still wants to go to a place far from crowds to paint, and I still want to stay at home to learn new technologies or develop products I like. But we&rsquo;ve both learned how to play the role of a &ldquo;good&rdquo; social person, forgetting how to play &ldquo;ourselves&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Realizing this change is actually a bit sad. It&rsquo;s not sad that we&rsquo;ve changed, but sad that this is what growth is, that this is what family and friends mean when they say &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve matured a lot&rdquo;. And growth, inherently, is a dispiriting affair.</p>
<h2 id="other-thoughts">Other Thoughts</h2>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/birthday_from_strangers.png" alt="birthday_from_strangers"></p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m still grateful for the people who have cared about and followed me over the past year, even though I no longer update weekly. I even woke up this morning to birthday wishes from a new reader I don&rsquo;t know, few words, yet warm and touching.</p>
<p>Growing up is indeed a dispiriting affair, but I&rsquo;m still willing to use weekly reviews to document these once black-and-white, uncompromising days, and I&rsquo;m thankful for all of you who have accompanied me through these times.</p>
<p>Happy 27th birthday to myself.</p>
<h2 id="special-event">Special Event</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using this blog to record my life for two years now, leaving behind many memories and fortunately getting to know all of you. I will select 6 friends from the comments on this blog post and send them small gifts I&rsquo;ve prepared, wishing you all continued happiness.</p>
<p>The draw will last until 23:59 on June 10th, UTC +8 time. The results will be announced in the Telegram Channel &ldquo;<a href="https://t.me/pseudoyulife">Yu&rsquo;s Life</a>&rdquo; and will also be replied to in the selected comments. I will contact you then. Thank you all again for your companionship.</p>

<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/yixi_ticket.jpg" alt="yixi_ticket"></p>
<p>I had attended several Yixi talks in Beijing before and quite enjoyed their style. By chance, I saw they were organizing a parent-child study tour in Nanjing. One of the arrangements was to visit the studio of designer/writer Zhu Yingchun, whom my senior greatly admires. So I borrowed a child (my sister) and signed up to participate together. Because I hadn&rsquo;t really recovered from the fatigue of rushing about these past two weeks, I didn&rsquo;t have very high expectations originally. Unexpectedly, we ended up having an interesting two days and one night.</p>
<h3 id="beside-bugs">Beside Bugs</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/zhuyingchun_trip.jpg" alt="zhuyingchun_trip"></p>
<p>Perhaps because I spent nearly ten years of my life in the countryside, at first I couldn&rsquo;t quite understand why there would be an activity like this to let a group of children look at bugs. Even for someone like me who debugs code at work every day, I can&rsquo;t say I have much fondness for bugs 🤣. But as we followed the teacher to observe the &ldquo;words&rdquo; written by various bugs, the &ldquo;paintings&rdquo; they drew, and the &ldquo;melodies&rdquo; they sang, I suddenly realized that I hadn&rsquo;t really looked at bugs properly in a very long time.</p>
<p>I still remember when I was young, I would take a net to catch cicadas and collect their shed shells as treasures. I would catch crickets in the grass to have them fight each other. I would curiously watch ants line up in a queue to carry something. If I saw a ladybug with unique spots, I would crouch down to observe it for a long time. Even after moving to the city, there were still cicadas singing at night, but to my ears they had become just noise and the stuffiness of summer.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/zhangyuxuan_speech.jpg" alt="zhangyuxuan_speech"></p>
<p>In the book &ldquo;Beside Bugs&rdquo;, the teacher befriends the bugs in the garden, seeing the world from their microscopic perspective, imagining their daily lives. There was even a session where they filmed a short movie of a little ant trapped in a pool, and asked the children in the group to use their imagination to draw pictures to rescue it.</p>
<p>Perhaps there are too many things that need to be contained in our eyes, yet these bugs are living truly and colorfully beside us, never having been gazed upon by my eyes. Along with them, my childlike innocence and curiosity about life have also disappeared.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/beside_bugs.jpg" alt="beside_bugs"></p>
<p>Yet my senior seems to have preserved this childlike innocence in some way. She would draw several teams of helicopter rescue squads to save the ant, and when the teacher was signing her treasured copy of &ldquo;Beside Bugs&rdquo;, she asked him to draw a caterpillar. When her wish was fulfilled, she even cried because her fan moment had come true.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I remembered an afternoon over half a year ago when I was wandering in front of the bookshelf at my senior&rsquo;s home, looking for a book to pass the time. She had recommended this book and another one with various forms of tigers drawn in it. I casually flipped through them and chose another one - I forget whether it was &ldquo;The Plague&rdquo; or &ldquo;Homo Deus&rdquo; or some other weighty classic. It&rsquo;s only now that I&rsquo;m slowly beginning to understand the importance of moments like understanding bugs in her past life.</p>
<h3 id="educational-philosophy">Educational Philosophy</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/yixi_speech_xuan.jpg" alt="yixi_speech_xuan"></p>
<p>Another interesting experience was the Youth Yixi Speech session at the end of this study tour. Each child needed to prepare a themed speech to share their thoughts and observations from these two days, while my senior and I, as parents, would assist with brainstorming and provide some guidance.</p>
<p>Although the discussion time was only about ten minutes, it clearly revealed the differences in educational philosophy between my senior and me. My senior tended to use guided questioning to help my sister gradually discover the impressive points from the several trips and the changes in her own thoughts. I, on the other hand, was more inclined to provide a clearer framework to help her organize her thoughts to ensure the best speech effect.</p>
<p>I deeply felt that the concepts and ways of thinking people have after growing up are often compensations for what was lacking in their own growth experiences.</p>
<p>I sometimes feel that if many moments of childhood had received more attention and guidance, I would have taken fewer detours. For things that would be judged in the spotlight, like grades and performances, I would pay more attention to the results themselves. Subconsciously, I would hope that she could gain more confidence and sense of achievement in these aspects. My senior, perhaps because her parents are teachers, always had more plans made for her. It seems that many things in her student days only needed to be completed step by step, thus lacking many opportunities for independence and self-exploration. Therefore, she pays more attention to stimulating my sister&rsquo;s own ideas and creativity, viewing any result as a precious experience in her growth.</p>
<h2 id="epubkit">EpubKit</h2>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/epubkit_intro.png" alt="epubkit_intro"></p>
<p>For the past few weeks, I&rsquo;ve been participating in the development of <a href="https://lutaonan.com/">Randy&rsquo;s</a> product <a href="https://epubkit.app/">EpubKit</a>. When I received his invitation, I was both surprised and delighted. I&rsquo;m primarily a backend developer, with only a mediocre grasp of React, and hadn&rsquo;t touched Electron before. But I cherished the opportunity to work closely with him, and the product itself greatly appealed to me. So I read the documentation a few times, learned about the IPC mechanism, and then started to write.</p>
<p>From initially adding small features like an update button to later collecting user requirements in the user group and completing them one by one in GitHub Projects, the whole process was very interesting and brought a great sense of achievement.</p>
<p>These weeks, as I&rsquo;ve been serving as a mentor for Open Source Summer and some training camp projects, I needed course materials. So I converted the blockchain/Solidity related tutorials I had written on my blog into epub format e-books. The experience was smooth, and it also reminded me of the concept of &ldquo;Eating your own dog food&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s truly wonderful when a tool you&rsquo;ve participated in developing happens to meet your own needs.</p>

<p>This piece chronicles my life and reflections from May 1st to May 15th, 2024.</p>
<p>During the May Day holiday, I traveled to Inner Mongolia with my family. It wasn&rsquo;t until we set off that I realized this was the first time we had ventured on a distant journey together. Previously, our furthest excursion had been a drive to Shanghai Disneyland. It was quite a different experience. Thus, in this piece, I&rsquo;d like to discuss family and kinship, as well as an unforgettable desert expedition.</p>
<h2 id="family-and-kin">Family and Kin</h2>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/family_photo.jpg" alt="family_photo"></p>
<p>Truth be told, I&rsquo;ve never been one to cling to home. I grew up in my hometown until I was seven or eight, then transferred to school in Hangzhou. Perhaps due to missing some childhood moments of togetherness, there was initially a sense of estrangement between my parents and me.</p>
<p>As a child, I was academically mediocre, inarticulate, and often loitered in arcades. While I may not have been a troubled youth, I was far from being the obedient and sensible child. My parents are the most honest and harmonious people I&rsquo;ve ever known. From my earliest memories to now, I&rsquo;ve never witnessed them quarrel, either as individuals or as a couple, and they seldom reproached me.</p>
<p>Around the age of twelve or thirteen, I seemed to suddenly mature. I began to focus on my studies and no longer caused my parents worry. From minor decisions like which subject to tutor, to major life-altering choices like forgoing a guaranteed college admission or filling out college applications, I made all decisions on my own. I realized early on that one must bear the consequences of their choices. My parents gave me the respect and freedom I deserved, but to my younger self, it felt like a lack of involvement and companionship. I even envied classmates who were &ldquo;overly cared for&rdquo; by their parents.</p>
<p>After the college entrance exam, I wished to leave the familiar Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Shanghai region and see more of the world. So I went to Wuhan. My life thereafter seemed to take on a nomadic quality, with many instances of moving houses or hurriedly departing for another city. Yet, I rarely felt homesick.</p>
<p>Of course, my relationship with my parents is good. Sometimes, when passing through Hangzhou on business trips, even if it&rsquo;s late at night, we&rsquo;ll chat in the living room for hours about my recent experiences and thoughts. I&rsquo;m also close to my sister, who chatters endlessly about interesting happenings at school when she sees me, and calls me first to boast when her grades improve. My parents are very caring towards me, driving thousands of kilometers to bring me back to Hangzhou from Beijing, and bringing me meals when I&rsquo;m holed up at home.</p>
<p>Perhaps because I&rsquo;ve grown accustomed to relying only on myself for so long, we interact more like friends. Thus, it&rsquo;s been difficult for me to draw strength from familial affection. But as I&rsquo;ve grown over the years, I&rsquo;ve come to understand the more precious things they&rsquo;ve given me, and I&rsquo;ve become more grateful for their &ldquo;letting go&rdquo; back then, which gave me more courage and confidence in facing life&rsquo;s vast ocean.</p>
<h2 id="desert-journey">Desert Journey</h2>
<p>However, I&rsquo;m slowly exploring modes of family interaction. It wasn&rsquo;t until the initial period of the pandemic when I was at home, and these past few months living in Hangzhou, that I experienced more moments that could be considered &ldquo;family bonding&rdquo;. Last summer, we went to Shanghai Disneyland together to celebrate my sister&rsquo;s birthday, and occasionally on weekend nights, the whole family would go out for hotpot. These seemingly ordinary events were indeed rare in my family&rsquo;s past twenty-some years.</p>
<p>My parents came to Hangzhou in their early years, settling down and establishing careers here. Their hard work provided us with good material conditions and a comfortable family environment, but they neglected their own lives. As a result, we hardly ever traveled far together from my childhood to now. Both my sister and I are self-content by nature, so we never complained about this, but we still lacked some family memories and hardly have any family photos.</p>
<p>Recently, due to certain circumstances, we had to go to Inner Mongolia. Having long yearned to see the vast grasslands and deserts, we decided to go to Ordos, Inner Mongolia as a family.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/desert_family_01.png" alt="desert_family_01"></p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/desert_family_02.png" alt="desert_family_02"></p>
<p>Having grown up in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and with my later life trajectory barely deviating from the southeast coast, this was actually my first time seeing a desert. It easily reminded me of the &ldquo;Dune&rdquo; movie I had just watched.</p>
<p>What matters is not the scenery itself, but the people who accompany you through these landscapes and the memories that settle in your heart together.</p>
<h2 id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h2>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/me_with_nienie.jpg" alt="me_with_nienie"></p>
<p>Recently, due to work pressures and some personal life questions, I&rsquo;ve been feeling mentally tense. One afternoon, after finishing work, I turned my head to find Nini had been by my side all along, gazing at me intently. I felt a sense of healing. As our time together grows longer, it seems I&rsquo;ve become more dependent on her presence.</p>

<p>This is a record and reflection of my life from <code>April 10, 2024</code> to <code>April 30, 2024</code>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s already mid-April since returning from Bali, welcoming another major change in life - moving back to Hangzhou from Beijing once again and renting a new place. The rhythm of life has subtly shifted as a result. Coincidentally, it&rsquo;s been a year since I last moved back to Hangzhou, so I&rsquo;d like to discuss my year of remote work in this piece.</p>
<h2 id="a-year-of-remote-work">A Year of Remote Work</h2>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/sunset.jpg" alt="sunset"></p>
<p>Last March, I experienced a job change, transitioning from commuting to an office to working remotely, and moved back to Hangzhou from Beijing, where I had lived for nearly two years.</p>
<p>At the time, I was eager to escape a busy yet meaningless job, and leaving Beijing was just a change of scenery. For me, although Hangzhou is my hometown, it was merely a temporary stop. I had left this city since high school, and ironically, only spent that half-year at home when the pandemic first broke out. Before that return, I hastily met with a few friends and colleagues to say goodbye. My parents drove to Beijing to bring back me, Nini, and all our belongings. Upon arriving in Hangzhou, we looked at just one or two apartments before deciding, and moved in the next day.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t expect so much to happen in just a short year. I won&rsquo;t dwell on the trivial matters, but rather share more about my feelings.</p>
<p>Actually, towards the end of my previous job, due to various factors like the pandemic and work modes, I already had some time when I didn&rsquo;t need to go to the office. However, because of endless meetings and colleagues&rsquo; work hours, it merely saved me from the commute. It wasn&rsquo;t until I settled in Hangzhou after starting my new job that I truly experienced the freedom of remote work. During that time, I wandered through multiple cities like Wuhan, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Hong Kong, Chengdu, and Xi&rsquo;an for an entire month, attending many events, often working late into the night to ensure complete work hours.</p>
<p>After just a month or two, the novelty of free travel had largely worn off, and I started to swing to the other extreme - staying at home and not going out. During this time, I spent a lot of time learning technologies I was interested in, writing blogs, reading books, and playing with Nini, thoroughly enjoying myself. But gradually, I discovered that although I&rsquo;m an introvert who relies more on self-dialogue to gain energy, the sense of loneliness and inertia brought by long-term isolation quickly depleted the accumulated energy. Despite having more time, it became harder to utilize the time outside of work properly, and anxiety followed.</p>
<p>Then, as I entered into a relationship, the focus of life gradually shifted, and I no longer confined myself at home. I frequently traveled back and forth to Beijing, gaining more sense of real life beyond work. I would pick up and drop off my senior at work, stroll in the park on nice days, cook together at home, and watch interesting dramas or documentaries while eating. My work and life seemed to have achieved a certain balance due to remote work, appearing enviably beautiful.</p>
<p>But this also had its problems. Just as many people bring work emotions into love or marriage causing conflicts, remote work makes it easier to bring life&rsquo;s inertia into work. However, while life always has its ups and downs, work, as a socialized activity of team collaboration, requires a more stable state and output. I often found myself in such a dilemma recently. There have been many changes in life in a short period, perhaps needing more time to adjust and reflect, while work has gradually become busier with project launches. I tried to do well on both fronts but fell into a vicious cycle of self-doubt.</p>
<p>To this day, I still haven&rsquo;t found a perfect solution or balance point, but I&rsquo;m gradually beginning to face and acknowledge my limited energy. I&rsquo;m willing to seek help for things I can&rsquo;t do well at work, and I also give myself moments to relax away from the computer after work or on weekends. Sometimes on Thursdays, I go to Crazy Thursday in Liangzhu to meet different people, and on weekdays, I arrange some undisturbed alone time with my senior, each of us reading, studying, or doing things we like.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also gradually realizing the need to set boundaries for myself and life. Even without punching in or commuting for work, there needs to be a time to get up, dividing time into intervals to arrange tasks, and also needing a ritualistic signal for the end of a day&rsquo;s work, such as going home for a meal or going out to the supermarket.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still exploring the lifestyle changes brought by remote work and still adapting to this new rhythm of life. But this year has made me focus more on my inner self. Life and home are no longer the cold refuges for temporary rest after work as before, but an extension of myself, and also attempts to get closer to myself.</p>
<h2 id="second-move">Second Move</h2>
<p>A year later, I&rsquo;m &ldquo;moving&rdquo; back to Hangzhou again. This time it&rsquo;s due to my senior&rsquo;s job transfer, and we&rsquo;ll be based in Hangzhou regularly afterwards. This move seems very different from before, more like moving a home from one place to another, welcoming a new life with a sense of ritual. We&rsquo;re decluttering many things we no longer need, trying to squeeze wine glasses or trinkets that once carried memories into some corner.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not really that concerned about the city itself and don&rsquo;t have much sense of belonging to cities. Even this move is just to a familiar place for me, and the process is similar to last year&rsquo;s. Yet I&rsquo;m full of more expectations for this move and the life that follows. Perhaps I&rsquo;m slowly understanding this line from The Little Prince:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This piece is a record and reflection of my life from <code>2024-04-01</code> to <code>2024-04-10</code>.</p>
<p>As I put pen to paper, it&rsquo;s already late May. Unknowingly, two months have slipped by. It&rsquo;s not just the weekly review updates; the multitude of recent events seems to have made it difficult for me to extricate myself from my entire life. But without realizing it myself, this weekly review, a vessel for recording life, has already become a part of me. Often, I feel as if I&rsquo;ve lost myself during this time without records, so I&rsquo;ve decided to reclaim it.</p>
<p>Unlike the usual compilations, this time I&rsquo;ll record in chronological order. Although the long time span inevitably means some details will be lost, the process of reminiscing still allows me to grasp some essence. This is the first piece, and I&rsquo;m striving to catch up.</p>
<h2 id="life-elsewhere">Life Elsewhere</h2>
<p>The latter half of March was busy with early morning driving practice and consecutive theory and practical driving tests. Though exhausting, it ultimately bore fruit when I obtained my driver&rsquo;s license on April 3rd. In previous chapters, I&rsquo;ve mentioned my lack of fondness for learning to drive, even feeling somewhat averse to it. But upon truly completing this task, I still felt an inexplicable sense of achievement. My subsequent travel in Hangzhou has indeed benefited from it.</p>
<p>Next came the Qingming Festival, which was also the long-planned trip to Bali.</p>
<p>Milan Kundera has a book called &ldquo;Life Is Elsewhere,&rdquo; and the title aptly describes my feelings at the time. I&rsquo;m not particularly fond of travel, nor do I have any special obsession or yearning for blue skies, white clouds, islands, and beaches. It&rsquo;s just that when various pressures of life come one after another, life elsewhere seems to offer a breath of fresh air. It&rsquo;s both an escape and a pursuit.</p>
<h3 id="vacation-and-travel">Vacation and Travel</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/bj_to_bali_airline.jpg" alt="bj_to_bali_airline"></p>
<p>Flying from Beijing to Bali requires a transit in the Philippines, with a total flight time of nearly 10 hours. After finishing &ldquo;The Red and the Black&rdquo; on my Kindle, I slept for most of the journey. When I awoke, it was nearly dusk. Looking out the window, the sunset overlapped with the clouds, and my mood seemed to brighten along with it.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/bali_blue_sky.jpg" alt="bali_blue_sky"></p>
<p>Exhausted, we arrived at the hotel in the early hours of the morning. Initially, the stuffy air and ubiquitous mosquitoes didn&rsquo;t leave a good first impression. But all emotions dissipated when we stepped out the next morning to see the beach, picturesque as a painting. The first two days&rsquo; itinerary mostly revolved around the beach and pool, typical vacation mode. But it wasn&rsquo;t until the second day, when I donned a local Balinese T-shirt and flip-flops, that my true journey began.</p>
<p>I once chatted with my senior about the difference between a vacation and travel. Like when we went to Qinhuangdao&rsquo;s Aranya for our anniversary, we cared more about being in an environment together; the important thing was a relaxed state of mind, regardless of the location. Subsequent trips to Beijing or Tangshan in Nanjing for hot springs were similar. Travel is different; the chosen place, food, culture, including the people you meet, are all important parts. I enjoy immersing myself and experiencing more; an unpalatable meal, the unpleasant exhaust from roadside motorcycles, or haggling with street vendors all become part of the memory.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, having seen spectacular waterfalls, monkeys covering entire mountains, sacred temple rituals, and so much more, what left the deepest impression was a shopkeeper lying relaxed on the floor of a small store in Kuta near the end of our trip. He remained lying down as we browsed through hand bracelets, only sitting up perfunctorily to haggle when we were paying, before lying back down again.</p>
<p>It seems that since a certain moment in college, I&rsquo;ve been busy with various things: academics, student organizations, work. It feels like I haven&rsquo;t had a truly empty moment since then. Of course, I&rsquo;ve had moments of daydreaming, laziness, or binge-watching shows, but I&rsquo;m referring to moments when I can truly think nothing.</p>
<p>Even knowing I won&rsquo;t use it, I always bring my laptop on trips. Like the various memes online, I&rsquo;ve attended meetings, written code at friends&rsquo; weddings, in amusement parks, restaurants, and even on roadside trash cans. It seems this is a lifestyle I acknowledge and even somewhat enjoy. But in Kuta, I seemed to see another way of life thousands of kilometers away in a foreign country. This life doesn&rsquo;t belong to me, nor is it where my heart lies, but I could feel the ease and comfort of &ldquo;doing nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="travel-snapshots">Travel Snapshots</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/bali_views.png" alt="bali_views"></p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/bali_snapshot.png" alt="bali_snapshot"></p>
<p>The rest are some regular travel records. Bali&rsquo;s scenery is indeed beautiful, but the food is really average; we mostly ate buffets at the hotel. After recuperating for two days in Nusa Dua, we went to Kuta, where <a href="https://t.me/pseudoyulife/2849">I tried surfing for the first time</a>. Although it was just in shallow waters, I tumbled many times in the waves and swallowed a lot of seawater. But after an hour of practice, I could already ride a few small waves. We hired a local guide on Klook who took us to waterfalls and the holy spring temple, and we even had our glasses knocked off by monkeys in the monkey forest. Apart from surfing, it was a fairly standard trip. We took some videos, perhaps there&rsquo;s material for a second vlog.</p>

<p>This piece is a record and reflection of my life from <code>March 25, 2024</code> to <code>March 31, 2024</code>.</p>
<p>The happiest event this week was meeting <a href="https://twitter.com/randyloop">Randy</a>. My fan dream came true, and we had a delightful conversation. To avoid impacting work, I woke up at 5 AM for four or five consecutive days to practice driving at the school. It was tough, but I passed the second stage of the driver&rsquo;s test in one go - worth it. I continued with fitness and exercise, and my overall physical condition is quite good. I&rsquo;m preparing to move back to Hangzhou after the holiday, feeling I might be able to participate in more &ldquo;Crazy Thursdays&rdquo;. There were many other interesting happenings as well.</p>
<h2 id="meeting-randy">Meeting Randy</h2>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/meet_with_randy.jpg" alt="meet_with_randy"></p>
<p>I once read an article saying that if you like a piece of writing, an open-source product, or anything, don&rsquo;t be stingy with words to express your gratitude and thoughts. Perhaps just a single sentence can greatly encourage the author. So, I quite cherish the opportunity to communicate face-to-face with the person behind the screen.</p>
<p>Long ago, I saw Randy post on Twitter that he was coming to Beijing and could meet for coffee. Last time he went to Liangzhu Yuniao Ji for Crazy Thursday, I happened to be away from Hangzhou and always regretted it. But when I actually had the chance to meet my idol face-to-face, I hesitated. There was the nervousness of a first meeting, and I worried about not having much to talk about and wasting his time.</p>
<p>I first learned about Randy around 2021, from a sentence at the end of an article by <a href="https://frostming.com/">Frost</a> titled &ldquo;Self-hosted, Free, Open-source Comment System Solution&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Finally, I also recommend <a href="https://lutaonan.com/">the author&rsquo;s blog</a>, which has high-quality content that greatly inspires thought.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At that time, I was just entering the tech field, didn&rsquo;t know many developers, and had no concrete concept of open source. I was just curious about what kind of person was behind such a niche, high-quality comment system, so I clicked in.</p>
<p>Before I knew it, I had read all the articles. I can say he met all the expectations I had at the time for the programmer I was about to become.</p>
<p>He had technological ideals and creativity, able to realize what he wanted to do through technology yet not confined by it; he had his own views and pursuits about life, with more interests and hobbies beyond code; he was willing to share his thoughts, with sincere and infectious writing; he was not bound by worldly standards and so-called halos, dropping out of undergraduate studies and quitting big tech companies.</p>
<p>At that time, I had not yet graduated from Hong Kong, was about to start job hunting and interviews, looking forward to yet confused about the upcoming tech career. I was worried about whether I could continue on this unknown path, and whether I would lose my creativity and passion for technology under heavy workload. It can be said that he showed me the kind of person I wanted to become in the future and the possibilities, and also made me truly start thinking about the essence of open source, sharing, and creation.</p>
<p>Later, I used his Cusdis comment system, and participated in some minor development when he recruited for the v2 team. We had our first private chat, and I received some code review and guidance; I followed his video to build my own personal project/knowledge management system with Logseq; when he released <a href="https://notepal.randynamic.org/">notepal</a> and <a href="https://epubkit.app/">epubkit</a>, I was among the first to experience them and report some small bugs; until this time when I mustered the courage to ask for a meeting.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/lego_hat.jpg" alt="lego_hat"></p>
<p>Before meeting, I wanted to choose a gift as a thank you for his inspiration and help all along. In the end, I chose a LEGO set of the Harry Potter Sorting Hat and a small book by Maugham titled &ldquo;Reading is a Portable Sanctuary&rdquo;.</p>
<p>For me, just stepping into the world of code, this &ldquo;magic&rdquo; world, there were countless unknowns and choices ahead. He was like the Sorting Hat, letting me listen to my inner voice and firmly choose my own path.</p>
<p>We happily chatted for over three hours after meeting. I was surprised and delighted to hear that he often reads my weekly reviews; I learned about his life state and thoughts after leaving Microsoft, consulted him about some of my confusions regarding work planning and development direction, collided on some ideas about independent blogs, front-end learning, and self-media, excitedly planned some interesting things, and much more.</p>
<p>The me who first clicked on Randy&rsquo;s blog homepage three years ago would never have imagined that one day I would be face-to-face with him in a coffee shop in Beijing, chatting freely. Besides the joy of successfully meeting my idol, I also marveled at the ups and downs and changes I&rsquo;ve been through. Everything seemed worth it.</p>
<h2 id="taking-the-drivers-test">Taking the Driver&rsquo;s Test</h2>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/kemu2_feichirensheng.jpg" alt="kemu2_feichirensheng"></p>
<p>During my senior year, I once learned to drive at a driving school near the university and even passed the second stage of the test. But due to various reasons like graduation, going to Hong Kong for studies, and the pandemic, I kept putting it off until it expired. The unpleasant experience of practicing driving under the scorching sun back then made me lack enthusiasm for learning to drive, and even feel somewhat resistant. It wasn&rsquo;t until this year that I made up my mind to start again.</p>
<p>After passing the first stage of the test before the New Year, I procrastinated again until mid-March to start practicing driving. I signed up for the second stage test on Thursday morning, and after four VR simulated driving practices, I woke up at 5 AM for three consecutive days this week to take the shuttle bus to the driving school for real car practice. The pain of early rising and the unpredictable positioning points made my anxiety peak on Wednesday. I took the early morning test with a casual attitude, but passed with a perfect score on the first try, so happy!!! It&rsquo;s been over two years since I graduated, and I feel like I&rsquo;ve regained the pressure and sense of achievement brought by &ldquo;exams&rdquo; that I haven&rsquo;t experienced for a long time through the driving test.</p>
<p>However, due to the devil&rsquo;s schedule of learning to drive in the morning, rushing work in the afternoon, and having to get up early the next day, it was difficult to take care of input and output this week. I hope I can pass the third stage smoothly next week!</p>

<p>This week, I rekindled much of my enthusiasm for work and learning, completing the long-listed blog comment system and data statistics system migration in my TODO list, giving me a sense of tidying up my desk. Over the weekend, I experienced oil painting for the first time, painting a new avatar for myself, filled with a sense of accomplishment. I resumed my fitness routine, continued learning to drive and registered for the second stage of the driving test. There were many other interesting events as well.</p>
<h2 id="oil-painting-experience-and-new-avatar">Oil Painting Experience and New Avatar</h2>
<p>My senior and I have vastly different personalities and interests. She has many hobbies I&rsquo;ve never ventured into, and what fascinates me often seems to be unknown territory for her. So, we recently set some goals to introduce each other to our own hobbies/skills. I chose double-pinyin input method and programming, with the former already showing significant progress. This week, she took me to an oil painting class.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually a complete novice when it comes to painting, and never thought I had any aptitude for such artistic pursuits. I was merely curious about what kind of attraction could motivate her to sit in a sketching or oil painting studio for half an afternoon, meticulously working on small details. I was both excited and a bit nervous.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/oil_painting_experience.png" alt="oil_painting_experience"></p>
<p>Normally, beginners wouldn&rsquo;t start with complex subjects like portraits, but I wanted a new avatar. The studio teacher was very accommodating and willing to guide me. We chose a photo focusing mainly on the &ldquo;head&rdquo; and began. Drawing the outline, mixing colors, applying paint, adding details based on light and position - everything was more interesting than I had imagined. The combination of a few simple colors could create many layers, and the act of creation itself was as mesmerizing as magic.</p>

<p>The result of an afternoon&rsquo;s work is shown in the image. Though the brushstrokes are novice, it&rsquo;s a work I created with my own brush, holding a unique significance. I&rsquo;ve changed my avatar across all platforms to this painting.</p>
<h2 id="blog-system-upgrade">Blog System Upgrade</h2>
<h3 id="cusdis-to-remark42">Cusdis to Remark42</h3>
<p>I previously wrote an article &ldquo;Lightweight Open-Source Free Blog Comment System Solution (Cusdis + Railway)&rdquo;, discussing how I used the self-hosted open-source <a href="https://cusdis.com/">Cusdis</a> comment system by <a href="https://lutaonan.com/">Randy</a>. I&rsquo;ve been using it since mid-2021, for a full three years now. Apart from some initial troubles with deployment platforms when Heroku and Railway started charging, it has been running steadily.</p>
<p>However, I&rsquo;ve encountered some issues during use:</p>
<ol>
<li>Probably due to some modifications in WeChat&rsquo;s built-in browser, the comment component isn&rsquo;t visible when the blog is opened from WeChat chats/dialogues.</li>
<li>Although email can be entered, it doesn&rsquo;t support subscribing to comment replies.</li>
<li>Comments need to be manually approved by the administrator, but the comment notification TG Bot often fails, causing me to miss comments.</li>
</ol>
<p>Moreover, as its core functionality hasn&rsquo;t been updated for a long time, it seems a bit rudimentary compared to other more mature comment systems. However, adhering to the principle of &ldquo;if it works, it&rsquo;s good enough&rdquo;, I hadn&rsquo;t considered migrating/updating. I even participated in some development of Cusdis V2 version during a period when I was learning front-end, but the development group became inactive not long after.</p>
<p>In recent months, because I hardly updated my blog, I didn&rsquo;t receive any notifications from the comment TG Bot. I thought there were no comments until recently when I had to change the Connection String of the Supabase platform hosting the database. I discovered that there were dozens of comments trickling in, some expressing care and encouragement, others inquiring about technical issues. By the time I saw them, it was already a month or two later, which made me quite embarrassed.</p>
<p>Additionally, when changing the database URI, Vercel deployment kept throwing errors. So I decided to migrate from Cusdis. After some research, I chose <a href="https://remark42.com/">Remark42</a>, which <a href="https://reorx.com/">reorx</a> also selected in his article &ldquo;Changing Blog Comment Systems&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In terms of configuration options alone, it&rsquo;s considerably richer than Cusdis. I&rsquo;ve currently set up several common social account logins (GitHub, Twitter, Telegram, email), allowed anonymous comments, supported email subscription for reply notifications, and also set up TG bot notifications. It&rsquo;s deployed on <a href="https://fly.io">fly.io</a>, with Go single binary + single file database, a very comfortable solution.</p>
<p>Because I had accumulated many comment data before, and Cusdis uses pg while Remark42 uses boltdb single file database, the latter doesn&rsquo;t support remote connections, so I couldn&rsquo;t directly write with SQL statements. I had to first export the required fields to a JSON file through a joined query, then manually execute the Migrator script (and because the official only supports wordpress, disqus and commento, I had to manually implement the conversion logic). Fortunately, it&rsquo;s written in Go, which I&rsquo;m familiar with. It took me a whole night to finish the <a href="https://github.com/pseudoyu/remark42/pull/1/files">pr</a>!!!</p>
<p>After the migration, I found that I had accumulated a total of 438 comments over the years. I was surprised myself, but they&rsquo;re all back!!!</p>
<h3 id="umami-to-goatcounter">Umami to GoatCounter</h3>
<p>With the mindset of &ldquo;since I&rsquo;ve changed the comment system, might as well update the data statistics system that&rsquo;s been a concern&rdquo;, I went ahead and updated it too.</p>
<p>Umami actually hadn&rsquo;t caused any problems, diligently running for a full year and a half until I replaced it. However, possibly because I started using it quite early, during a major version update, there was an incompatible field update in the database Migration script. I don&rsquo;t quite understand why an open-source project of this scale would have such issues. I saw many other users in the issues with similar concerns, but ultimately no good solution was provided.</p>
<p>But because I had been running it for half a year, I was reluctant to lose the previous data. So I kept putting it off, until now I&rsquo;m still on an old version that I forked. Although I don&rsquo;t have many functional demands for the new version, it just feels a bit uncomfortable, like mild OCD, but I just kept postponing it.</p>
<p>So, taking advantage of this major blog construction, I switched to <a href="https://www.goatcounter.com/">goatcounter</a>. Again, it&rsquo;s a Go single binary + sqlite single file database deployed on fly.io, another very comfortable configuration.</p>
<p>Interestingly, because the author of goatcounter is very persistent, believing that containerizing such single-file applications would actually increase maintenance costs, they don&rsquo;t provide official images. However, having an image is still convenient for deploying on your own VPS or serverless platform, so I used Github Actions to create a CI that pulls the latest code daily, builds the image and uploads it to Docker Hub. If you need it, you can use it. The corresponding Dockerfile and Docker Compose file can be referenced from <a href="https://github.com/pseudoyu/goatcounter/pull/1/files">this PR</a>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">docker pull pseudoyu/goatcounter
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/yu_umami_record.png" alt="yu_umami_record"></p>
<p>The frequency of weekly reports in the past half year is worryingly low. Apart from a long article about information management systems, there hasn&rsquo;t been any satisfactory output. So I decided not to migrate the previous visit data (the complexity should also be much higher). Thanks to every cyber friend who clicked into my blog website, screenshot for remembrance.</p>
<p>Recently, I feel like my mood for tinkering with these software/hardware/service configurations has returned, and I also have many blog ideas. The new data will be a new beginning 🫡</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/yu_goatcounter_data.png" alt="yu_goatcounter_data"></p>
<p>The biggest motivation for the change was that goatcounter&rsquo;s interface, like my old-school blog theme, perfectly hits my aesthetic sweet spot. I feel like I could stare at this interface forever 🤩 I can&rsquo;t resist this Retro Internet design.</p>
<h2 id="some-thoughts-on-self-hosting">Some Thoughts on Self-Hosting</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve actually gone through many rounds of tinkering and back-and-forth with VPS and serverless platforms. It may not count as insights, but it&rsquo;s certainly experiential knowledge after deep experience.</p>
<p>I used to be an advocate for serverless. At that time, I would deploy on Vercel/Railway and other PaaS platforms if possible, rather than setting up myself. Being able to achieve stability comparable to large platforms with almost no maintenance costs, I indeed practiced serverless-izing all my services, and it was indeed a worry-free and effortless experience for a long time.</p>
<p>However, after experiencing Heroku and Railway successively changing their charging models midway, and when n8n ran up a bill of over ten dollars a month on Railway, I gradually discovered some drawbacks. Serverless indeed reduced the requirements for maintaining my own servers, but correspondingly, I was also subject to the rules of these platforms.</p>
<p>The charging model is only part of the reason. Compared to renting a well-configured server myself, the cost is actually not bad. It&rsquo;s just that it seems to have tied my services and data to a centralized platform again, giving a sense of insecurity of being at someone else&rsquo;s mercy. And when wanting to migrate to another platform, the platform often doesn&rsquo;t provide a convenient solution. The complexity of tinkering yourself is much higher than directly copying docker-compose files plus mounted volumes between servers.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/vps_service_01.png" alt="vps_service_01"></p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/vps_service_02.png" alt="vps_service_02"></p>
<p>Therefore, I&rsquo;ve put many of my services on the server, running steadily for 430+ days.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/xiao_self_hosted.png" alt="xiao_self_hosted"></p>
<p>A few days ago, when chatting with <a href="https://reorx.com/">reorx</a> about service deployment solutions, he mentioned that he now prioritizes self-host solutions with sqlite or other similar file databases, which can reduce a lot of maintenance and migration costs and complexity.</p>
<p>Later, I thought about it. Whether on VPS or serverless platforms, it&rsquo;s essentially a choice of self-hosting. What&rsquo;s more needed is to think about the dependencies of the deployed services themselves. For example, many of the instabilities of my previous Cusdis and Umami actually came from the server-side being on PaaS like Vercel and Netlify, while the data was hosted on DaaS like Supabase. A self-use service depending on two platforms simultaneously, any problem with either would lead to service unavailability. What VPS does is just turn this risk into a single point of self-maintenance.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/flyio_services.png" alt="flyio_services"></p>
<p>So I started tinkering again after a long time, deploying Remark42 and GoatCounter on <a href="https://fly.io">fly.io</a>. Because of single binary + file database, the performance consumption is completely within the range of the free plan. I continue to place RSSHub, n8n, image bed and other applications that are relatively more dependent and need to provide external services more centrally on VPS. And I run some services with higher performance or storage consumption on the Home Server and expose them through intranet penetration solutions.</p>
<h2 id="other">Other</h2>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/applite_overview.png" alt="applite_overview"></p>
<p>I unified the software installed on Mac from various sources. The principle is to reinstall everything that can be installed via brew cask. Previously, when needing to search for command line tools, I didn&rsquo;t feel much, but now with a GUI view, I found that the software sources are indeed much richer than imagined. This method is convenient for management/migration and can relatively ensure the security of software sources 🫡</p>
<p>Switched from RapidAPI to a new API debugging tool <a href="https://www.usebruno.com/">Bruno</a>, pre-ordered its Golden Edition, and the experience has been very good so far.</p>

<p>This piece is a record and reflection of my life from <code>2024-03-01</code> to <code>2024-03-16</code>.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the previous weekly review, I embarked on a drifting plan, which concluded with a nearly two-week journey through &ldquo;Hangzhou -&gt; Shanghai -&gt; Huzhou -&gt; Nanjing -&gt; Beijing&rdquo;. Mostly confined to Jiangsu and Zhejiang, there weren&rsquo;t any extraordinary landscapes; it was more about people and events. Due to my main wallet being stolen without determining the cause, I reinstalled two primary computers, which provided an opportunity to reorganize my development environment configuration. I set up the Mac Studio at home as a 24/7 Home Server, running constant applications like Home Assistant to control smart home devices - a tinkering process that proved quite interesting. At work, our team&rsquo;s long-awaited Alpha mainnet went live, bringing back a sense of excitement I hadn&rsquo;t felt in a while. There were many other intriguing occurrences as well.</p>
<h2 id="drifting-plan">Drifting Plan</h2>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/tianmushan_view.jpg" alt="tianmushan_view"></p>
<p>The first stop of my post-New Year drifting plan was Shanghai. Over the years, I&rsquo;ve been there dozens of times, from one or two-month internships to brief stopovers. Usually, these visits were for specific purposes or to meet people. Truly &ldquo;living&rdquo; there was a rare opportunity. This time, I didn&rsquo;t choose a bustling area or plan any special outings. Instead, I booked a week-long stay at a rental near a friend and resumed my normal work and study routine.</p>
<p>Occasionally, I&rsquo;d venture out to nearby commercial areas for food. On weekends, I met up with long-unseen college roommates for meals. The rest of the time, I worked from the hotel, even managing to finish the long-awaited &ldquo;Westworld&rdquo; series. Coincidentally, a colleague lived just a kilometer or two away, leading to a small three-person team gathering.</p>
<p>Next, I visited Huzhou, staying at my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/gxgexiao">Xiao</a>&rsquo;s place for a week. Our encounter stemmed from a tweet he posted a year ago during his <a href="https://www.gexiao.me/2023/07/01/lets-wander/">wanderings across various places</a>, inviting friends in Hangzhou to meet. At that time, I had just returned to Hangzhou, full of uncertainty and anticipation for my future life. Mustering courage, I arranged a dinner and a stroll by West Lake. Despite it being our first meeting and having little in common, it was genuine and trusting.</p>
<p>Later, he moved to Huzhou. I had planned to visit in August but couldn&rsquo;t make it due to various reasons, which left me feeling regretful. So, I took this drifting opportunity to fulfill that promise. We hiked off-trail in Moganshan, walked along the cliffs of Anji&rsquo;s Cloud Prairie, and visited two digital nomad communes. I was quite drawn to their community atmosphere. This year, I seem to have rediscovered a long-lost sense of relaxation in life, becoming more willing to meet people and experience new things. Life is no longer just about work and study; people and everything related to human connections have become more appealing to me. Due to deeper connections with many &ldquo;online friends,&rdquo; the boundaries between my online and offline relationships have gradually blurred.</p>
<p>Thanks to the company&rsquo;s &ldquo;Work Together 1 Hour&rdquo; every Wednesday, a colleague recommended the hot springs in Tangshan and the forest library in Moganshan. So, I arranged to meet with a senior schoolmate in Nanjing, enjoying a leisurely week and starting to explore some weekend getaway destinations. Life has become more tangible.</p>
<h2 id="stolen-wallet-and-device-reinstallation">Stolen Wallet and Device Reinstallation</h2>
<p>Recently, I reinstalled the systems on both my laptop and home desktop. The catalyst was the unfortunate theft of my main wallet. Based on the blockchain records, it happened around noon on the first day of the Lunar New Year. All assets in the wallet (including some airdrops from participating in open-source projects) were converted to ETH and BNB before being transferred out. The wallet still contained my ENS and some NFTs (<del>which the hacker apparently didn&rsquo;t care for</del>). The overall financial loss wasn&rsquo;t significant, but because I couldn&rsquo;t pinpoint how the private key was leaked, I had no choice but to reinstall all device environments - a major undertaking.</p>
<p>Since both systems were macOS, the system settings and software aspects were fairly straightforward. I mainly referred to my personal toolbox project &ldquo;<a href="https://github.com/pseudoyu/yu-tools">GitHub - yu-tools</a>&rdquo;, but made quite a few subtractions, keeping only the essentials. I discovered that after uninstalling <a href="https://www.rewind.ai/">Rewind</a>, my MacBook Pro&rsquo;s battery life improved significantly - I can now go out almost without needing to bring a charger.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/x-cmd_env_install.png" alt="x-cmd_env_install"></p>
<p>I also took this opportunity to organize my software installation sources, development environment management, and command-line configurations. I tried out the &ldquo;<a href="https://cn.x-cmd.com/">x-cmd</a>&rdquo; project developed by a friend&rsquo;s company.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/zshrc_config.png" alt="zshrc_config"></p>
<p>Combined with ohmyzsh, I simplified my command-line configuration to just a dozen or so lines. Later, I can manage various environments and command-line tools through commands like <code>x env</code>, which is very user-friendly.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/x-cmd-env-ls.png" alt="x-cmd-env-ls"></p>
<p>Finally, I used <code>x env</code> to manage my Go, Node, and Python development environments, eliminating the need for various steps like installing nvm and setting environment variables. I also experienced enterprise-level customer support (referring to bombarding my friend on Telegram to solve problems 🤣). It will become part of my standard setup in the future, and I&rsquo;m still in the process of deep exploration.</p>
<p>Additionally, I unified the management of ssh keys and GPG signatures between the two devices. Combined with Elpass for password management and automatic server login, I achieved a seamless experience switching between commuting and staying at home.</p>
<h2 id="home-server--home-assistant">Home Server &amp; Home Assistant</h2>
<p><del>Perhaps as I&rsquo;m getting older</del>, I couldn&rsquo;t escape the three great temptations: routers, charging heads, and NAS. For the router, I&rsquo;m using the Asus AC86U I bought from <a href="https://twitter.com/strrlthedev">STRRL</a> last year, flashed with the latest Merlin firmware, which is quite sufficient, so I didn&rsquo;t bother with software routers. As for charging heads/chargers, after experiencing the Flashex fully transparent power bank, 100W GaN charger, and Hard Candy Factory mini charger (<del>which I&rsquo;m a bit wary of using now</del>), I&rsquo;ve cooled off on that front as well.</p>
<p>Finally, I extended my reach towards NAS. After a long chat with Ares, our reliable ops &amp; deep NAS DIY enthusiast in our team, I decided to first use the Mac Studio at home as a Home Server.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/yu_home_assistant_macstudio.png" alt="yu_home_assistant_macstudio"></p>
<p>The first thing I did was connect all the smart devices at home to Home Assistant. However, due to the Apple M1 chip, there was no ready-made official solution. After much tinkering, I finally followed the article &ldquo;<a href="https://siytek.com/home-assistant-macos-utm-debian-12/">Run Home Assistant on macOS With a Debian 12 Virtual Machine</a>&rdquo; to install an Arm architecture Debian virtual machine using UTM. I ran a full version of Home Assistant inside it and used frp to map the interface to the public network. Finally, I operate it directly using the iOS app and web version. The current solution might have issues with the virtual machine&rsquo;s network mode, so I can&rsquo;t add it to the Apple Home App via HomeKit Bridge yet, but being able to link all the Xiaomi, Yeelight, and Petkit pet devices is sufficient for now.</p>
<p>As a Home Server, it maintains 24/7 operation with barely noticeable noise and power consumption. I enabled smb file sharing, ssh remote login, and remote vnc desktop control, and ensured I could access home devices from outside through intranet penetration.</p>
<p>To ensure security and stability, I adopted three different intranet penetration solutions simultaneously:</p>
<ol>
<li>frp</li>
<li>Surge Ponte</li>
<li>Cloudflare Argo Tunnel</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using the first solution for nearly two years, as detailed in the article &ldquo;<a href="https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2022/07/05/access_your_local_devices_using_reverse_proxy_tool_frp/">Thin Client Development Workflow Based on frp Intranet Penetration</a>&rdquo;. It requires a public network server but is simple to configure and stable. Currently, I&rsquo;ve only retained the ports for ssh and Home Assistant.</p>
<p>The second solution achieves convenient intranet penetration between macOS/iOS devices through the Surge software. You can see its detailed introduction in &ldquo;<a href="https://kb.nssurge.com/surge-knowledge-base/guidelines/ponte">Surge Ponte Guide</a>&rdquo;. It requires a proxy line that supports UDP, but is otherwise almost plug-and-play. I use it to access files on the home Mac Studio and some local services, and can also directly access and configure home intranet routers from outside, mainly for personal use.</p>
<p>The third solution was recently added after seeing the article &ldquo;<a href="https://nova.moe/accelerate-and-secure-with-cloudflared/">Accelerate and Secure Your Website with Cloudflare Argo Tunnel (cloudflared)</a>&rdquo;. Previously, I had been manually configuring it using the cloudflared command-line tool, which was somewhat troublesome, so I hadn&rsquo;t put it into practice. Recently, Cloudflare integrated it into <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/">Zero Trust</a>, allowing almost all operations to be configured through the interface. I use it to run some services that need to be exposed to the public network on the home server. For example, the other day I ran a <a href="https://ollama.com/library/codellama:70b">codellama:70b</a> using <a href="https://ollama.com/">ollama</a>, and then accessed it directly through <a href="https://chatkit.app/">ChatKit</a>. The experience was quite good, just a bit slow in generation, so it was more of a trial run.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, our company&rsquo;s <a href="https://rss3.io/blog/en/introducing-rss3-alpha-mainnet">Alpha mainnet</a> has just gone live. I plan to run one myself on the Home Server when the public node is available, but can&rsquo;t afford to run it now 🤣.</p>
<h2 id="vr-driving-lessons">VR Driving Lessons</h2>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/vr_car_learn.png" alt="vr_car_learn"></p>
<p>Due to some upcoming self-driving needs, I re-enrolled in driving school to start learning. This driving school has VR driving facilities, which I found less intimidating than I had imagined.</p>
<h2 id="other-matters">Other Matters</h2>
<p>There don&rsquo;t seem to be many other interesting things to mention. I find myself alternating between busyness and anxiety over not being able to do all the things I want to do, but everything is slowly getting better.</p>
<p>GitHub provided a free Copilot license for open source, allowing me to continue freeloading on code completion and Copilot Chat. Combined with Claude 3 Sonnet and the free GPT4 tokens from &ldquo;<a href="https://burn.hair/register?aff=isWf">burn.hair</a>&rdquo;, I can now meet all my coding and various other needs.</p>
<p>Oh, and I managed to arrange a meeting with my idol programmer &ldquo;<a href="https://lutaonan.com/">Randy</a>&rdquo; in Beijing at the end of the month!!!</p>

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>This piece is a record and reflection of my life from December 4, 2023, to February 29, 2024.</p>
<p>Much has transpired over the past few months, across various dimensions of life, making it challenging to begin writing this weekly review, which was originally intended to document daily life and personal thoughts. It seemed that no single or even two issues could summarize everything, and at the same time, I couldn&rsquo;t bring myself to merely record a series of events without mentioning my feelings.</p>
<p>So, I gave myself a long holiday, so long that I found myself staring blankly at the document multiple times, wondering if I still had the ability to be a &ldquo;weekly review&rdquo; blogger.</p>
<p>I often say that my writing stems from my life, and when life is in disarray, I&rsquo;m unable to convey my feelings. Yet, I&rsquo;m also often too lazy to sort through and face the ups and downs that life brings. On many weekend nights, I convinced myself: &ldquo;In January, definitely before the New Year, after the New Year, or maybe the Lantern Festival would be good too,&rdquo; until February 29th of this leap year, a day that actually has no special connection to me but somehow feels ceremonial, I finally mustered the courage to restart.</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;ve never lacked the desire to share, only the courage to start anew.</p>
<h2 id="the-blank-three-months">The &ldquo;Blank&rdquo; Three Months</h2>
<p>After much hesitation, I decided to start by recounting the past three months, following the chronology of events and the changes in my state of mind.</p>
<p>In &ldquo;Weekly Review #52 - Self-Deprecating Personality and Another Perspective on Relationships,&rdquo; I mentioned that my girlfriend and I are very different people. Of course, in that piece, I described more of the positive aspects of these differences. Little did I know that while differences in thinking and behavioral habits bring curiosity and mutual appreciation, one must also be prepared to bear the cost of disparities in personality and values.</p>
<p>Perhaps I had already realized this, but I allowed myself to indulge in the more concrete joys of life, while some cracks were quietly growing. Specific incidents can always be debated right and wrong in the moment or after emotions have settled, but inevitably, some feelings are lost in the process. I often think of myself as a lucky person, always receiving a lot of tolerance in relationships and other aspects of life. While jokingly saying &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t deserve this,&rdquo; I had actually become accustomed to it. It wasn&rsquo;t until conflicts erupted that I realized there was no such thing as luck; the silence and tolerance were actually layers of armor brought by the love I received, which would eventually break.</p>
<p>So, we experienced the end of a relationship, frank and sharp conversations, physical and psychological isolation, and learning to get along and love again. It seems that in just a few short months, we&rsquo;ve traveled a long road, with mud and forks, but fortunately, we still have trust and love for each other, and we&rsquo;ve decided to walk the path ahead hand in hand.</p>
<h2 id="life-adrift">Life Adrift</h2>
<p>Rather than &ldquo;adjusting my life state&rdquo; as I often said for the past half year, these few months have been more about truly choosing the direction and focus of my life. I gave up my fixed residence in Hangzhou and began a true &ldquo;semi-nomadic&rdquo; life. While in Hangzhou, I often sought out homestays near Liangzhu to stay for a few days, participating in some activities at Yumiao Ji. Now, after the New Year, I&rsquo;ve embarked on a drifting plan, following the high-speed rail route from Hangzhou to Beijing that I&rsquo;ve taken countless times, experiencing the atmosphere of different cities one stop at a time.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/anhui_view.jpg" alt="anhui_view"></p>
<p>Actually, this idea originated from a high-speed train ride from Hangzhou to Beijing. As I happened to look out the window, we passed by Bengbu in Anhui province, and I saw this stunning view. I suddenly realized that I had passed through this place dozens of times, had seen its name in many internet memes, yet never thought my life would have any intersection with it, and perhaps I might never set foot there in this lifetime.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just places, but people too. Some friends live not far away, just an hour or two&rsquo;s journey, and we always say &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come visit you when I have the chance&rdquo; in our chats, but it remains just words. This idea actually comes from people always believing too much in the promise of future days, only to regret when a certain moment arrives.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/chat_with_maggie.jpg" alt="chat_with_maggie"></p>
<p>Last Christmas Eve, my colleague Maggie passed away. In terms of frequency of communication, we certainly couldn&rsquo;t be called close friends, but it all started with a casual work chat where she read my Eight Characters (a form of fortune-telling), which opened up many personal topics. When we talked about relationships, she told me about the scoundrel she encountered in the financial industry; she happily told me she was going to be a lecturer at Baptist University next year and asked how my school taught web3 when I was studying in Hong Kong; she read through the interview between polebug and me, saying she used to be an English major too; she talked about her undercover experiences and journalistic ideals when she was doing in-depth financial reporting at Sina Finance; and much more.</p>
<p>When I first heard the news, I was in a state of numbness, like what Camus described in &ldquo;The Stranger,&rdquo; until later when I saw that she had posted on WeChat Moments on December 20th saying, &ldquo;My Oura reminded me that I actually have a fever.&rdquo; Remembering that she had mentioned this when I asked about gifts, I went back to check the records, and all the emotions suddenly welled up. I finally felt the reality of the departure of a real friend who often brought laughter.</p>
<p>After experiencing this period, it seems the weight of life has changed somewhat.</p>
<p>I visited my high school buddy Jian Zi, who lives just three or four subway stops away in Beijing, we played badminton together a few times on weekends, and I invited him over for dinner; I met up with several college roommates in various cities, whom I had thought I might never see again after graduation, and we talked about all sorts of things from these years; I had dinner with high school friends during the Spring Festival, and after the New Year, I started drifting along the route &ldquo;Hangzhou -&gt; Shanghai -&gt; Huzhou -&gt; Nanjing -&gt; &hellip;&rdquo; to see the people and sceneries along the way.</p>
<h2 id="spring-festival">Spring Festival</h2>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/neimeng_with_boyi.jpg" alt="neimeng_with_boyi"></p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s Spring Festival was particularly lively. I spent half the time following my girlfriend to her hometown in Inner Mongolia, and the other half bringing her to Hangzhou to meet my family and friends. The journey was tiring and nerve-wracking, but also wonderful. Although I can&rsquo;t pinpoint exactly why, after this week, I seem to feel that the bond between us has become stronger, and our interactions seem to have gained a bit more ease.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always believed that a person is composed of their personality, thoughts, and the environment of their growth experiences. While it&rsquo;s impossible to accompany someone through their past, visiting the people they cherish or simply walking the paths they&rsquo;ve walked is like an exploratory journey to understand a person, bringing more trust and courage, which are also important components of love.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/seal_from_boyi.jpg" alt="seal_from_boyi"></p>
<p>During the Spring Festival, it happened to be Valentine&rsquo;s Day, and my girlfriend carved a seal with my name on it.</p>
<h2 id="adjusting-learning-state">Adjusting Learning State</h2>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/duolingo_profile.png" alt="duolingo_profile"></p>
<p>After a period of busy work and low mood in life, when I tried to fulfill my learning plans again, I always felt a bit powerless and distracted, always a bit out of sorts. Plus, I happened to see some interviews about Duolingo, so I thought I&rsquo;d register and pick up German, my second foreign language that I hadn&rsquo;t touched for years (English majors are required to choose another language as a second foreign language). Fortunately, some basic knowledge and foundation were still there, and I found a lot of fun in it.</p>
<p>After a while, I gradually became more able to settle down and spend a few hours learning something new. It&rsquo;s a kind of &ldquo;self-cultivation&rdquo; through language learning, I suppose. The leaderboard feature is also very insightful about human nature; I would spend some time during my lunch break to climb back up if I saw someone had surpassed my ranking.</p>
<h2 id="other-matters">Other Matters</h2>
<p>Actually, many things happened, but with such a long period, I don&rsquo;t know where to start.</p>
<p>Work has been very enjoyable these past few months. Towards the end of last year, our team&rsquo;s core project was <a href="https://github.com/RSS3-Network/Node">fully open-sourced</a> and decentralized. The development path has gradually become clear with the white paper and various plans. We often have two to three-hour meetings discussing details, which I find enjoyable. Open-sourcing has also brought requirements for code quality and standards, leading to a lot of growth.</p>
<p>I edited a life vlog - &ldquo;Life Wandering Guide #01 | Sketching in the Old Summer Palace | Chaoyang Beer Festival | Trip to Inner Mongolia | Anniversary in Aranya&rdquo;, rediscovering the joy of video creation, which is another way of preserving and recording life.</p>
<p>Life restarts along with the weekly review. Thank you to the friends who continued to leave encouraging comments and show concern for me on my blog during this period. Let&rsquo;s keep moving forward together.</p>

The grandfather was once an architect. What left a deep impression was that during filming, the grandfather passed away. In life, he only liked to use wooden spoons instead of metal ones for eating. Afterwards, in the grandmother&rsquo;s solitary life, she would always place a meal with a wooden spoon in front of his memorial photograph. A very plain yet warm narrative.</li>
<li><a href="http://movie.douban.com/subject/35208467/"><strong>Someday or One Day</strong></a>, The only thing to say might be that it fulfilled the regret of the drama version&rsquo;s ending. The rest, whether logic or pacing, fell far short.</li>
<li><a href="http://movie.douban.com/subject/33456512/"><strong>Angry Sea</strong></a>, The plot itself is a bit weak, with some seemingly deliberately created conflicts and somewhat affected &ldquo;madness&rdquo;. However, the oppression, fear, morbid possessiveness, and impotent anger lingered long after the movie ended. The last time I had a similar feeling was after watching &ldquo;A Sun&rdquo;.</li>
<li><a href="http://movie.douban.com/subject/26761416/"><strong>Darkest Hour</strong></a>, Timely transitions, tense music, and my favorite typewriter scenes immediately immersed me in that desperate moment. It also gave me my first impression of Churchill beyond the few brushstrokes in history books. Combined with &ldquo;Dunkirk&rdquo; which I had watched before, I could feel the sense of reality and weight in history.</li>
<li><a href="http://movie.douban.com/subject/35712804/"><strong>1947 Boston</strong></a>, Too much deliberately presented heroism coupled with a flat sense of rhythm, somewhat disappointing. However, the ending was unexpected, real and bold.</li>
<li><a href="http://movie.douban.com/subject/35725869/"><strong>Nobody but You</strong></a>, I originally wanted to watch it in the cinema before the New Year, but kept putting it off until the source was out. It&rsquo;s a standard comedy, but the theme is quite new. As I&rsquo;ve started working myself, I could actually find some sense of reality in the humor.</li>
<li><a href="http://movie.douban.com/subject/34963356/"><strong>The Past Lives of the Deluge</strong></a>, My favorite movie I&rsquo;ve watched recently. You could say there&rsquo;s almost no plot, but the visuals, dialogues, and psychological descriptions are all beautiful. It reminds me of a drama I liked before, &ldquo;Normal People&rdquo;. Although his role wasn&rsquo;t big, Arthur is really a genuine and warm person, a very attractive character.</li>
<li><a href="http://movie.douban.com/subject/1291856/"><strong>The Dreamers</strong></a>, Supplementary tag. I watched it around my freshman year of college. Rebellious, passionate, indulgent, and free to the extreme, it formed my initial definition of &ldquo;romance&rdquo; when I was (still) young. The scene of running in the Louvre still leaves a deep impression on me.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="tv-series">TV Series</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://movie.douban.com/subject/34874646/"><strong>Blossoms Shanghai</strong></a>, I&rsquo;ve always had high expectations for Hu Ge&rsquo;s dramas, and his temperament also fits Mr. Bao very well. Apart from the ending part which seems a bit hasty, it&rsquo;s one of the most impressive Chinese dramas I&rsquo;ve watched this year. The set design and cinematography are truly beautiful!</li>
<li><a href="http://movie.douban.com/subject/33394370/"><strong>Street Food</strong></a>, Niche street food, always feel that Southeast Asian street food vendors have a sense of mission and belonging to their careers, and the food also has a soul.</li>
<li><a href="http://movie.douban.com/subject/36155049/"><strong>Love in Flames of War</strong></a>, I watched it intermittently because it was directed by a film editing vlogger I knew about, but maybe my expectations were too high, I found it mediocre after watching.</li>
<li><a href="http://movie.douban.com/subject/35727023/"><strong>The Makanai: Cooking for the Maiko House</strong></a>, Currently watching.</li>
<li><a href="http://movie.douban.com/subject/36140095/"><strong>The Newsroom</strong></a>, I&rsquo;ve always been quite interested in news so I watched it when it was popular. The pace was quite eye-opening at first, but in the last few episodes, the vilification and redemption of the main characters lacked some driving force, as if it was hastily wrapped up.</li>
<li><a href="http://movie.douban.com/subject/33425914/"><strong>Workers</strong></a>, I had watched &ldquo;Silent Workers&rdquo; before and have always been fascinated by Taiwan&rsquo;s work culture. I was attracted by a B-site clip about Xiao Jie (although it mainly talked about his father&rsquo;s generation). Just a few small clips could make me feel his clarity, sincerity and kindness. When watching many plots, I couldn&rsquo;t help but feel anxious for the protagonists. &ldquo;How did they get cheated again&rdquo;, &ldquo;Why are they so stupid&rdquo;, including at the end, I was also annoyed that &ldquo;good people don&rsquo;t get good results&rdquo;. But this is their instinctive choice when facing hardships, it&rsquo;s the way they live seriously. Even though they think about making money every day, they still make admirable choices in the face of righteousness and kindness.</li>
<li><a href="http://movie.douban.com/subject/36156235/"><strong>A Time Called You</strong></a>, A very fresh rebirth drama. Although the plot can be guessed from the beginning, the daily narrative and interspersed jokes are very dense. Although it can&rsquo;t be called an ensemble cast, the depiction of the main characters is also very full.</li>
<li><a href="http://movie.douban.com/subject/2338055/"><strong>Westworld</strong></a>, I&rsquo;ve always looked forward to having a game close to &ldquo;thinking&rdquo; like Westworld. I guess the closest I can imagine is Minecraft with built-in GPT.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="anime">Anime</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://movie.douban.com/subject/35366293/"><strong>Bocchi the Rock!</strong></a>, Maybe I started watching it after seeing some clips. It&rsquo;s indeed cute but not lonely at all, it&rsquo;s just an introverted person surrounded by love.</li>
<li><a href="http://movie.douban.com/subject/36190888/"><strong>Spy x Family Season 2</strong></a>, Anya is just too cute!</li>
<li><a href="http://movie.douban.com/subject/34895145/"><strong>Jujutsu Kaisen</strong></a>, The setting and plot development feel a bit like &ldquo;Chainsaw Man&rdquo;, and the overall pacing is quite good!</li>

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>This is a record and reflection of my life from November 30, 2023 to December 3, 2023.</p>
<p>On Sunday evening, while organizing various files, I realized upon opening the document that many previous issues were written in the crevices of workdays. Coincidentally, I returned to Hangzhou on Friday night, having more time to myself. I thought about not delaying the weekly review until midweek to avoid rushing.</p>
<p>I spent much of my journey and weekend reading books and catching up on anime. &ldquo;Frieren: Beyond Journey&rsquo;s End&rdquo; was captivating; I couldn&rsquo;t help but binge-watch 13 episodes, leaving me wanting more. It even rekindled my longing for the world of swords and magic, making me consider playing &ldquo;Fire Emblem Engage&rdquo;. However, while the Switch was charging, I started reading &ldquo;Neurosis and Human Growth&rdquo;, which consumed an entire day. By the weekend&rsquo;s end, I hadn&rsquo;t even turned on the Switch. Having not exercised much due to illness for two weeks, I resumed running, revisiting Hangzhou&rsquo;s night scenery, reminiscing about that time in July and August, feeling as if it were a lifetime ago. There were many other interesting happenings as well.</p>
<h2 id="the-self-effacing-personality">The &ldquo;Self-effacing&rdquo; Personality</h2>
<p>I often sense the awkward aspects of my personality brought about by past experiences, yet find myself at a loss on how to change. This week, I finished reading &ldquo;Neurosis and Human Growth&rdquo;. I rarely read such books; I&rsquo;ve read &ldquo;Inferiority Complex and Transcendence&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Courage to be Disliked&rdquo; before, which, although resonating, left me feeling helpless. This book was recommended once and added to my reading list. When I started reading it over the weekend, I was captivated and finished it in a day, finding myself in many descriptions of the &ldquo;self-effacing&rdquo; type.</p>
<p>I find the most valuable aspect not to be any solution - psychological healing is not something that can be effective merely through theories from a few books. What&rsquo;s precious is its apt description of behaviors and thought patterns that I find difficult to articulate, to the point of astonishment.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/neurosis_and_human_growth_02.png" alt="neurosis_and_human_growth_02"></p>
<p>This passage resonated with me the most. I don&rsquo;t consider myself overly indecisive, but I often seem to mess things up when faced with conflicts between love (in a broad sense, not limited to romantic feelings) and the rhythm of life itself. It&rsquo;s like a consistently functioning program encountering an inevitable bug under specific conditions. The reason isn&rsquo;t hard to find - I simply want both and can&rsquo;t give up either.</p>
<p>I used to think it was perfectionism at play, making me expect a solution that satisfies both sides. Later, I gradually realized it wasn&rsquo;t entirely that, but rather the conflict itself creating a strong sense of disorder, which I fear. In such moments, I don&rsquo;t confide in either party about the problem I&rsquo;m facing or seek help. Instead, I stubbornly pursue what I believe to be the optimal solution, one that can balance both sides. However, reality often makes it difficult to achieve both, leading to self-criticism and deprecation due to inability, which in turn triggers an even stronger sense of disorder.</p>
<p>This description might seem abstract, but a recent example comes to mind. In late August, I received an invitation for the muChiangmai mentor program, offering an opportunity to stay in Chiang Mai for a while. The condition was to complete an English Solidity Workshop, a challenging yet anticipated journey.</p>
<p>At that time, I was also planning my first trip with my senior. So, I thought about suggesting we go to Chiang Mai together during the National Day holiday. My senior was excited about this, starting to look at flight tickets and travel guides early on, buying pretty dresses, and asking me every couple of days if the itinerary was confirmed and when we could book tickets. Meanwhile, I was busy with work accumulated due to month-end deadlines and considering the workshop topic, never providing a concrete plan.</p>
<p>Until one day, my senior said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s just my imagination, but it feels like you don&rsquo;t really want to go to Chiang Mai with me.&rdquo; Only then did I realize that I wasn&rsquo;t actually too busy to even glance at flight times. Rather, I felt a strong sense of conflict and anxiety about simultaneously achieving &ldquo;I should ensure that my first trip with my senior is perfectly planned&rdquo; and &ldquo;I should complete an English Workshop in Chiang Mai that satisfies me&rdquo; within a short week. Unable to decide, and lacking confidence to manage well amidst many unknowns, I began to feel dejected about this disordered self, making it even harder to perceive my senior&rsquo;s emotions and feelings.</p>
<p>In such moments, it didn&rsquo;t occur to me to communicate this issue with my senior. Instead, I wrestled with myself until everything collapsed. In fact, during later communication, my senior expressed that she only wanted to leave footprints and memories of the two of us in another country, without much pursuit or obsession with Chiang Mai or the trip itself. I had added too much invisible pressure on myself in my imagination.</p>
<p>Of course, this is life, not a story. Belated realizations don&rsquo;t necessarily lead to a happy ending for all. As seen in &ldquo;<a href="https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2023/11/07/weekly_review_20231107/">Weekly Review #48 - Inner Mongolia Trip, Chiang Mai Digital Nomad, Restarted Weekly Review and Life</a>&rdquo;, our trip didn&rsquo;t materialize. I went to Chiang Mai alone, and even now, &ldquo;traveling together&rdquo; remains a difficult topic for us to discuss lightly.</p>
<p>A few days ago, when we were discussing some previous thoughts, my senior sent me a fragment of her diary from that day, which included this passage:</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/boyi_diary_20230903.png" alt="boyi_diary_20230903"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>He needs a sense of order. He can accept small disorders (occasional rain, casual daily life), but large-scale disorders (journey, relationship) overwhelm him.</p>
<p>I should give him more time. Pushing doesn&rsquo;t work; he needs to figure it out himself. I should just do what I need to do at this time.</p>
<p>&ndash; 20230903</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I&rsquo;m in a state of disorder, I&rsquo;m grateful that she fully understands what I&rsquo;m facing and trying to overcome, rather than just an exchange of emotions. Seeing this passage long after still moves me.</p>
<h2 id="another-perspective-on-love">Another Perspective on Love</h2>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/flower_to_boyi.jpg" alt="flower_to_boyi"></p>
<p>Perhaps because this is my weekly review, most of the time I narrate events from my perspective. A few days ago, during our chat, I saw some fragments of my senior&rsquo;s diary for the first time, which was interesting to look back on.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/boyi_diary_20230618.png" alt="boyi_diary_20230618"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today, his WeChat messages were frequent, giving me enough sense of security. He must like me&hellip; right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s enjoyable being with him. This week feels like a summer dream, making the entire June seem somewhat unreal.</p>
<p>&ndash; 20230618</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was the week I mentioned in my &ldquo;<a href="https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2023/07/10/weekly_review_20230710/">In the Mood for Love</a>&rdquo; post, about going to Shanghai and Beijing. At that time, my feelings were budding, yet I felt awkward and at a loss.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/yu_weekly_review_love.png" alt="yu_weekly_review_love"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although the Shanghai trip lasted only two days, changes were quietly taking place, with emotions growing and spreading in my heart. We wandered on the Bund, guessing the words on the buildings across the river or on passing boats. Despite having umbrellas, we let ourselves get drenched in the sudden rain, laughing like two people who never grew up.</p>
<p>When we parted at Hongqiao, we both understood that we could no longer maintain that tacit understanding, yet I became afraid, hesitant, and evasive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afraid of the feelings sprouting within me, fearing that my flawed self couldn&rsquo;t bear such a complex relationship, and also fearing that I might be insincere in indulging in momentary joy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was probably the most accurate depiction of my state at that time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Looking back after a long time, it&rsquo;s interesting to see the contrast. She was frank and sincere, while I was timid and struggling, these two hearts gradually drawing closer. Until:</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/boyi_diary_20230706.png" alt="boyi_diary_20230706"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>OMG! We&rsquo;re together now, love came so fast like a tornado. Let&rsquo;s go with the flow, just be happy when he&rsquo;s around.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In terms of getting along and understanding each other, we are truly completely different people.</p>
<p>I come from the southeast coast, she grew up in the northwestern desert; she is decisive in her actions, sometimes with a bit of a <del>temper</del>, while I am unhurried and can indeed wear down her temper; we studied under the same mentor, yet our career paths are entirely different; she enjoys rock climbing, boxing, surfing, and various sports, while I would rather stay in front of the computer for two months; she needs to sleep by 10 PM, I have no drowsiness even at 3 AM; our dietary habits are poles apart, we couldn&rsquo;t find similar types of food in our plates from a not-so-large buffet restaurant; she needs the home to be orderly and refined, while my sense of order might come from organizing apps by color in folders and changing to a favorite theme color in VS Code; I love watching movies and anime, while she feels life is too short and prefers to seek a pure land through reading. &hellip;</p>
<p>Sometimes we marvel at how two such different people came together, and other times we feel it was meant to be, just as I quoted from a poem by Neruda on a card when sending flowers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>everything carries me to you,</p>
<p>as if everything that exists,</p>
<p>aromas, light, metals,</p>
<p>were little boats</p>
<p>that sail</p>
<p>toward those isles of yours that wait for me.</p>

<p>This piece is a record and reflection of my life from <code>2023-11-22</code> to <code>2023-11-29</code>.</p>
<p>This week, my senior and I were both confined at home recovering from influenza A, which significantly impacted our work and daily life. I finished recording the podcast I mentioned last time, chatting casually for over an hour. Despite running a fever for two days over the weekend, I struggled to go out on Sunday to attend Lawrence&rsquo;s offline event. After the fever subsided, I went to the hospital for a check-up just to be safe. There was nothing serious, but I still need to wait for a full recovery. Many interesting things happened as well.</p>
<h2 id="lawrence-the-deer">Lawrence the Deer</h2>
<p>A long time ago, I streamlined my input sources and reduced the time spent on various media platforms, cutting down my follows to less than 100. However, Bilibili remains an app I open daily, with &ldquo;<a href="https://space.bilibili.com/37029661">Lawrence the Deer</a>&rdquo; being the primary reason.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/meet_lawrence_1.jpg" alt="meet_lawrence_1"></p>
<p>I started following him about three or four years ago. Back then, Lawrence often traveled in search of himself, leaving behind many memories in Japan. Perhaps it was due to some similar scenes, or his lonely yet intense love for this world, I always felt his lens and narration had a beauty reminiscent of Hirokazu Koreeda. Later, in a Q&amp;A session, I heard that his favorite director is also Hirokazu Koreeda. Indeed.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/meet_lawrence_2.jpg" alt="meet_lawrence_2"></p>
<p>Later, he met Ms. Mi.</p>
<p>I watch each of their videos as soon as they&rsquo;re released. I&rsquo;ve seen Ms. Mi&rsquo;s figure gradually appear in his lens, stories about him and his cat, dialogues with his ten-year-ago self, the ritual of year-end summaries, up until the recent proposal. It&rsquo;s hard for me to describe what kind of beauty exists between them. They both have their own lives and pursuits, progressing on their own trajectories, yet mutually attracted, rescuing each other, pulling each other out of loneliness.</p>
<p>At that time, I was also seeking my own path - &ldquo;<a href="https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2020/06/06/yearly_review_23/">A 23-year-old&rsquo;s Confession: In Pursuit of Meaning</a>&rdquo;. Confused, at a loss, yet stubbornly pursuing the meaning of life itself. Later, I also experienced studying abroad for what I wanted to do, the pain of losing loved ones, the confusion of life changes, and so on. When I felt overwhelmed with sadness, I would repeatedly watch Lawrence&rsquo;s videos, finding that I could always find empathy in his narratives, which gave me strength. Later, I started keeping cats, recording these life moments through writing, saying some words to myself in year-end summaries, and capturing some life fragments with a camera after regaining the courage to live. Later, I often received feedback from readers who found resonance or drew strength from my writings. Suddenly, I realized this might also be a kind of passing on the torch, transmitting the encouragement I received to more people.</p>
<p>This time, I was fortunate enough to get a ticket to Lawrence&rsquo;s sharing session at &ldquo;Today At Apple&rdquo;. He talked a lot about his creation and life itself. I was familiar with all the memes and video details he mentioned, and that&rsquo;s when I realized that this had become a part of my life.</p>
<p>He mentioned that <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Gc411z7mu">the next video</a> would also be tearful yet joyous, and he used a muting technique similar to Oppenheimer. Little did I expect it to be a proposal!!! Congratulations!!!</p>
<h2 id="snapshots-of-this-week">Snapshots of This Week</h2>
<p>Indeed, I feel my physical condition has declined this year. In April, I had a rather severe acute gastroenteritis, and in May, I tested positive for COVID for the first time (though I recovered in two days). This week, I caught influenza A and had a fever for a few days, with considerable aftereffects still lingering. It&rsquo;s truly uncomfortable. I need to pay more attention to keeping warm in autumn and winter. Plans are falling behind more and more, which is troublesome.</p>
<p>Also, because I&rsquo;ve been cooped up at home for too long, I haven&rsquo;t done much extra, nor had much energy to cook. I hope everything gets back on track soon. This weekend, I&rsquo;ll go back to Hangzhou for a while first. I&rsquo;ll be able to see some colleagues and go to the long-missed &ldquo;Crazy Thursday&rdquo; at Liangzhu.</p>

<p>Although most interesting inputs are automatically synced in the &ldquo;Yu&rsquo;s Life&rdquo; Telegram channel, I&rsquo;ll still select some to list here. It feels more like a newsletter now.</p>
<h4 id="books">Books</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://book.douban.com/subject/6764127/">Up At the Villa</a>, a small book, sort of a &ldquo;mystery novel&rdquo; without much plot, with more dialogue and psychological descriptions, yet still quite engaging to read in one sitting. It tells a story of &ldquo;desperate love&rdquo;. A young violinist regains hope for life due to Mary&rsquo;s &ldquo;love&rdquo; bestowed upon him, only to have it quickly shattered, leading to suicide; Edgar only loves the pure and flawless Mary in his memory and imagination; Rowley is a wealthy playboy, yet loves most purely, passionately, and recklessly; Mary is conflicted, clearly knowing her own heart, wavering due to wealth and status, yet insisting on confessing everything that happened to her completely before accepting Edgar&rsquo;s love. Behind love, there&rsquo;s quite a bit of utilitarianism, self-righteousness, and self-satisfaction. Perhaps only by screening these out can one truly feel the purity of love itself.</li>

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>This piece is a record and reflection of my life from November 13 to November 21, 2023.</p>
<p>This week had quite a bit of discussion and development at work, maintaining a normal rhythm. My days were largely occupied by work, study, and additional reading, giving me a sense of fulfillment. As I plan to spend more evenings reading books, I hurried to finish the few dramas and anime I was watching. Over the weekend, I took a stroll in the Temple of Heaven Park and discovered a delicious mushroom hotpot in the evening. I also gave two 4-hour Solidity Bootcamp sessions for OpenBuild, and the preparation process was quite interesting. Next week, I&rsquo;ll be participating in a podcast recording as part of the 2023 Podcast Festival, which I&rsquo;m looking forward to. There were many other interesting happenings as well.</p>
<h2 id="a-stroll-in-the-temple-of-heaven">A Stroll in the Temple of Heaven</h2>
<p>Autumn in Beijing is fleeting, but perhaps the only truly pleasant season of the year. It&rsquo;s cool but not cold enough to require layers of thick clothing, perfect for a leisurely walk.</p>
<p>Before setting out, my senior suddenly suggested I leave my camera behind, adding, &ldquo;Every time you bring the camera, you&rsquo;re not as relaxed during the stroll.&rdquo; I paused, realizing she was right. It seems that after developing the habit of documenting, I tend to think more about capturing or writing down moments I find joyful or interesting, sometimes neglecting to fully enjoy the present beauty. Like when we went to Aranya, walking on the beach as dusk fell, I was so focused on getting good shots quickly that I spent a long time photographing each scenic spot. In the end, I did get some nice photos, but I missed out on the true essence of a &ldquo;stroll&rdquo;. The 55mm focal length of the camera inadvertently created a sense of distance.</p>
<p>This time, I went without any particular purpose, just for a walk. We followed the park visitors doing tai chi, competed to see who could throw pine cones into a circle made of grass, and watched a few chickens with feathers as vibrant as peacocks scurrying about in the woods, perhaps in courtship. Though I&rsquo;ve always thought of myself as someone not particularly drawn to natural landscapes, preferring themed street photography, this leisurely stroll in the company of others brought many pleasant surprises. It helped alleviate some of the recent tension and anxiety, making time feel especially slow.</p>
<p>Afterwards, we ate at a Yunnan mushroom hotpot restaurant called &ldquo;Tang Ba Shi&rdquo; that I had been craving for a long time. Highly recommended!</p>
<h3 id="rediscovering-reading">Rediscovering Reading</h3>
<p>Recently, I&rsquo;ve spent most of my dinner and post-dinner time watching or rewatching some TV series: &ldquo;Reply 1988&rdquo;, &ldquo;Nirvana in Fire&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Prison Playbook&rdquo;. While enjoyable and relaxing, time seemed to slip away quickly. So, after making an effort to finish these, I decided not to start any new series and instead return to reading.</p>
<p>Last year, I read many books, accompanied by my Kindle during subway commutes. Despite the harsh environment, I found joy in it, sometimes reading 1-2 books a week. However, in the past six months, without the need to commute, I lost some of that reading mindset, mainly focusing on reference books. These past few evenings, as I started reading again, I found I could once again enjoy it. While it might not be possible to complete my reading goals set at the beginning of the year, rediscovering the pleasure of reading is a greater gain.</p>
<p>I first finished &ldquo;Building A Second Brain&rdquo; and &ldquo;PARA Method&rdquo;, the latter being a supplement to the former. Both are about personal knowledge management, with the former focusing more on concepts and methodologies, and the latter on specific practical methods. Being tool and practice-oriented, they were not difficult to read, and provided some additions to my current system using Logseq + Readwise + Heptabase.</p>
<p>A colleague in our group chat mentioned &ldquo;Homo Deus&rdquo;, reminding me that I had read this and &ldquo;Sapiens&rdquo; a few years ago. Personally, I&rsquo;m not as fond of such grand narrative topics compared to literary works, but this series is exceptionally engaging. I considered revisiting them, but then noticed &ldquo;21 Lessons for the 21st Century&rdquo; on my bookshelf and decided to read it first, having gone through the first few chapters.</p>
<h3 id="the-feynman-technique">The Feynman Technique</h3>
<p>Recently, I&rsquo;ve been involved in teaching a course called &ldquo;<a href="https://openbuild.xyz/learn/courses/95">[OpenBuild Bootcamp] Solidity from Beginner to Expert</a>&rdquo;, responsible for two sessions. As it&rsquo;s during after-work hours and weekends, I&rsquo;m using the Chinese version of the training materials from the previous Chiang Mai Workshop.</p>
<p>I seem to be quite enthusiastic about participating in education and sharing, which is also a practice of the Feynman Technique. Its core lies in:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you prepare to learn new knowledge, you must stand in the position of a teacher, assuming you need to explain this knowledge to others.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, especially when I&rsquo;m still in the learning stage myself, I cherish opportunities to share and teach. Last May, I gave a technical presentation for Chainlink and wrote several blog posts. This year, I was a mentor in Chiang Mai and participated in a workshop. Compared to before, I now have a more solid grasp of core concepts.</p>
<p>Speaking of my learning path for Solidity, I&rsquo;ve completed all three of Patrick Collins&rsquo; Solidity tutorials on YouTube, each lasting several dozen hours.</p>
<p>The first was the Brownie (Python) version, which I watched in June 2021 while in quarantine after returning to Shenzhen from Hong Kong. At that time, I didn&rsquo;t understand many concepts and had little practical experience. I chose it over Truffle, which I had used for my graduation project, mainly because Python&rsquo;s syntax for writing tests seemed simpler. I roughly went through it in about a month, managing to handle a few smart contract development job interviews. Later, as I started working on consortium chains, I didn&rsquo;t use it much.</p>
<p>The second was the Hardhat (Javascript) version, which I watched in May 2022 while in home quarantine. By then, I had a better understanding of smart contracts and had written quite a few practical ones, so it was more of a reinforcement. It took only about half a month, and I produced several blog articles. Patrick himself noticed and contacted me, leading to many subsequent opportunities.</p>
<p>The recently completed Foundry (Solidity) version came after I had already worked on quite a few projects and was familiar with most concepts. However, it took nearly two to three months, with much of it watched in parts. I feel that as I&rsquo;ve written fewer technical blogs, there&rsquo;s been a noticeable decline in my concentration and state of learning knowledge. I need to pick it up again.</p>
<h2 id="interesting-things-and-objects">Interesting Things and Objects</h2>
<h3 id="podcast-festival">Podcast Festival</h3>
<p>This week, I have the opportunity to record a podcast, which will be part of the &ldquo;2023 Tech Podcast Festival&rdquo;. Other participants include podcasts I really enjoy like &ldquo;Maple Syrup&rdquo;, &ldquo;Beyond Code&rdquo;, &ldquo;Jinjinledao&rdquo;, &ldquo;Kernel Panic&rdquo;, and more. Last year, I listened to various themes from this event, and I never imagined I&rsquo;d have the chance to participate this year. It&rsquo;s quite amazing.</p>
<h3 id="input">Input</h3>
<p>Although most interesting inputs are automatically synchronized on the &ldquo;Yu&rsquo;s Life&rdquo; Telegram channel, I&rsquo;ll still select a few to list here, making it feel more like a newsletter.</p>
<h4 id="books">Books</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Building a Second Brain</strong>, I&rsquo;ve actually already learned about and practiced the methods mentioned in the book through other blogs. I was more interested in understanding the author&rsquo;s thought process and practical methods, but found it to be more theoretical.</li>
<li><strong>The PARA Method</strong>, compared to &ldquo;Building a Second Brain&rdquo;, this book is more concise and easy to read, with a strong focus on practical methods. The principles regarding using a system across multiple platforms and the flow of information between PARA have significant reference value for my current system.</li>
<li><strong>21 Lessons for the 21st Century</strong>, the last book in the trilogy</li>
<li><strong>Uniswap V2 Book | RareSkills</strong>, I&rsquo;ve always wanted to understand Uniswap in more detail</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Pluto</strong>, an anime about robots and humans that I came across on Netflix. I&rsquo;ve always been interested in this genre. I finished it during lunch breaks and weekends. It deals with hatred and love, with the hatred aspect being quite grand, running through the theme &ldquo;hatred leads nowhere&rdquo; and a heroic protagonist group. What left a deeper impression on me was actually the love between the law enforcement robot and his wife, and between Gesicht and Helena at the beginning. For them, simply choosing to remember was already the most difficult and great choice.</li>

<h4 id="tv-series">TV Series</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prison Playbook</strong>, a work by the same director as &ldquo;Reply 1988&rdquo;, which I chose for after-dinner relaxation. It&rsquo;s funny while maintaining its style. Although it&rsquo;s a male-led script, the presentation is a group portrait that I really like. Many of the supporting characters, even with limited screen time, leave a deep impression. Another aspect I appreciate is that the series doesn&rsquo;t deliberately beautify human nature, like the drug addict who immediately returns to drugs after being released. It also doesn&rsquo;t pursue perfection, such as the male lead not winning his first comeback match. It&rsquo;s more about showcasing the diversity and growth of people.</li>

<p>This piece is a record and reflection of life from <code>2023-11-08</code> to <code>2023-11-12</code>.</p>
<p>This week, I returned to a normal rhythm. Work-wise, the main task was discussing and designing solutions, without much coding involved. For another AI-related project, I wrote some backend API code related to smart contracts and call chains. Although I&rsquo;ve written quite a few contracts, opportunities for non-demo projects that string together the entire process are still rare. In terms of exercise, I had two personal training sessions, and my condition was quite good. In terms of life, I cooked a few meals, and my senior created an online document to record recipes and menus. I can feel that my culinary skills seem to be improving. I sorted out some previously shot video materials, planning to edit a version, which would be a video version of the review. I rearranged my office environment in Beijing, making it much more comfortable. I went shopping and bought some seasonal clothes. There were many interesting things happening.</p>
<h2 id="the-burnt-keyboard">The Burnt Keyboard</h2>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/hanwen_keyboard_burnt.jpg" alt="hanwen_keyboard_burnt"></p>
<p>The most interesting (?) thing this week was probably when I was working overtime one night and suddenly smelled something burning. I shouted to my senior, &ldquo;Something seems to be burning!&rdquo; and continued writing. After a while, the burning smell seemed very close to me, and I shouted again, &ldquo;It might be my computer or keyboard burning,&rdquo; and then continued writing. A bit later, the keyboard stopped responding. I picked it up and sniffed it, and there was a strong burning smell. It turned out that the keyboard really did burn.</p>
<p>At that moment, I didn&rsquo;t think much of it, but looking back, my reaction was quite funny. Perhaps I was debugging a bug and was in a focused state, so my reactions to the surroundings were like programmed outputs. I guess I&rsquo;m the type of person whose first reaction to an earthquake would be to <code>git commit</code> + <code>git push</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/hanwen_chat_with_support.jpg" alt="hanwen_chat_with_support"></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using this keyboard for almost a year. It&rsquo;s the Hanwen 75 from &ldquo;【Self-made】I Made a Modular Mechanical Keyboard!【Soft Core】&rdquo; designed by Zhi Hui Jun. The appearance and feel were quite nice. I contacted customer service, and they said it was probably a burnt cable and that I needed to contact after-sales for inspection. They said this was the first case they had encountered.</p>
<p><del>I guess my coding skills have really improved, I even managed to burn the keyboard with my code.</del></p>
<p>My senior: &ldquo;Do you want me to buy you insurance? Being a programmer is truly a high-risk occupation.&rdquo; 🤣</p>
<h2 id="the-myth-of-pompeii">The Myth of Pompeii</h2>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/pompeii_01.jpg" alt="pompeii_01"></p>
<p>My senior&rsquo;s company had some art exhibition benefits that could include family members. Thinking we shouldn&rsquo;t always stay at home on weekends, we chose to go to the National Library of China on Saturday to attend an exhibition called &ldquo;The Myth of Pompeii — Treasures from the National Archaeological Museum of Naples, Italy&rdquo;. It included several sections: &ldquo;Back to the Golden Age&rdquo;, &ldquo;Love Myths in Ancient Greece and Rome&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Joy of Life: Ancient Romans&rsquo; Love for the Good Life&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Concept of Beauty in Ancient Art&rdquo;, and &ldquo;The Rebirth of Myths&rdquo;.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/pompeii_02.jpg" alt="pompeii_02"></p>
<p>Because it included a guided tour, we listened to fantastic Greek myths while looking at the ordinary yet not simple daily life of that era, creating a strange sense of harmony. I think compared to the ancient tomb groups in China that only royalty could enjoy, this suddenly disappeared city seems to better showcase the original face of a city, giving it a more authentic feel.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/pompeii_03.jpg" alt="pompeii_03"></p>
<p>In our imagination, 2000 years ago seems like a distant era, but judging from the state of Pompeii, their pursuit of life far exceeds ours today. The gourmet food, paintings on tableware, various paintings and sculptures of the gods they believed in, and interestingly, the small city of Pompeii had more than twenty brothels and many murals depicting sexual love. Their openness to sex and desire was even far greater than today.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/pompeii_06.jpg" alt="pompeii_06"></p>
<p>The volcanic eruption permanently stopped time at this moment, without having to experience aging and slow death, which perhaps precisely fits their attitude towards life. Their daily life embodies &ldquo;seize the day&rdquo; and &ldquo;the ultimate pursuit of beauty&rdquo;. Their longing and praise for love itself are also reflected in their artworks. I think besides religion, they also firmly believed in a good life and love itself.</p>
<h2 id="a-magical-dream">A Magical Dream</h2>
<p>Something very magical happened on Sunday night.</p>
<p>I was thinking of finishing the weekly review at night, but I was very tired after a whole day of working out and shopping. I thought about putting the computer by the bedside and waking up around three o&rsquo;clock to write (<del>but I didn&rsquo;t wake up in the end</del>). I had a dream in the middle of the night, probably because for some reason my MacBook accidentally broke into two halves. The last moment in the dream was probably regretting not buying AppleCare. When I woke up startled, my hand grabbed the laptop that was about to slip from the pillow to the ground.</p>
<p>Perhaps I&rsquo;ve become so in tune with my computer that it sensed the danger and sent me a dream to save it. It was a very magical dream. Adding to this week&rsquo;s release of OpenAI&rsquo;s GPTs and a series of new features, and having just watched PLUTO, an anime about humans and robots, I suddenly couldn&rsquo;t tell whether I was looking forward to or fearing this future.</p>
<h2 id="health-adjustments">Health Adjustments</h2>
<h3 id="fitness">Fitness</h3>
<p>About a month ago, I started twice-weekly personal training sessions at the gym. Actually, I haven&rsquo;t been very concerned about my body for many years, and thanks to a fairly good constitution, I rarely even had minor illnesses. In high school and college, I would do some basic sit-ups and push-ups in the dorm, which could probably maintain good fitness and physique. However, as I grew older and my routine became increasingly uncontrollable due to some extra factors in work and life, I gradually started thinking about increasing the frequency and amount of exercise.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/yu_body_params.png" alt="yu_body_params"></p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/yu_body_param_2.png" alt="yu_body_param_2"></p>
<p>After comprehensive consideration, I signed up for personal training at the gym, usually two sessions a week, from 7-8 am on Wednesday/Thursday and 2-3 pm on Sunday, basically covering all the points I want to exercise. Now I&rsquo;ve had 7 sessions, and this is the body condition measured before the first session. I should measure again after one or two more sessions to see if there&rsquo;s any improvement.</p>
<p>Working out is really quite an interesting activity. The first two times were very novel, trying to do a little more in each item to break my own limits. After a few sessions, there would occasionally be times of weariness and poor condition. I would often glance at the clock on the wall during some difficult movements, thinking it was too long. Now that I can clearly see some results, I&rsquo;m somewhat accustomed to and even looking forward to that feeling after exercise.</p>
<h3 id="diet">Diet</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/food_weekly_review_20231113.png" alt="food_weekly_review_20231113"></p>
<p>As my fitness and life rhythm have become more stable, I&rsquo;ve started cooking more for myself. Although it takes a bit more time every day, I feel it&rsquo;s quite an interesting experience, and life seems to have become more concrete.</p>
<h2 id="interesting-things-and-objects">Interesting Things and Objects</h2>
<h3 id="shopping-and-couple-outfits">Shopping and Couple Outfits</h3>
<p>Beijing has actually entered winter, and the temperature has dropped sharply these days, but I haven&rsquo;t prepared any thick clothes yet. After working out on the weekend, I thought it was time for a seasonal change and should go buy some.</p>
<p>So we went to the mall near home, and my senior and I shopped for a few hours. It wasn&rsquo;t until after we finished that I suddenly realized this was probably our first real shopping trip to buy clothes together. It&rsquo;s quite amazing, it seems like we&rsquo;ve been together for a long time, but we can still discover many new things we haven&rsquo;t done. It&rsquo;s not related to how close the relationship is, maybe it&rsquo;s more about the mode of interaction. Neither of us deliberately tries to check off &ldquo;x things that must be done&rdquo;, everything just happens naturally.</p>
<p>Then we went to support Cali&rsquo;s Zolplay Mall and bought a set of &ldquo;<a href="https://shop.zolplay.cn/products/404-not-found-hoodie-y23">404 Not Found</a>&rdquo; couple hoodies. Looking forward to seeing them when they arrive.</p>

<p>This piece is a record and reflection on my life from <code>2023-09-17</code> to <code>2023-11-07</code>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a while since I last put pen to paper, almost a month and a half. A lot happened in the first couple of weeks, and there were many things I wanted to record, but I never managed to find a few hours to complete the weekly review. I thought I&rsquo;d have time during the National Day holiday, but I went to Inner Mongolia, and after returning, I went to Aranya to celebrate the 100-day anniversary with my girlfriend. The trips were enjoyable but draining; before I could recover from the journey, I caught an early morning flight to Chiang Mai to attend an event, where I met many familiar yet never-before-seen friends from the internet and gave my first English workshop. Then I returned to Hangzhou to meet old friends, attend a friend&rsquo;s wedding, and reunite with high school classmates. During this time, an elderly family member had an accident, and my parents often had to travel back and forth to my hometown, leaving them unable to care for Nini, so I brought her back to Beijing. Thankfully, the journey went smoothly, and we can be together again. At the same time, I was still somewhat dissatisfied with my work status and focus, and it took nearly a month of gradual adjustment to get back on track. There were many other things too.</p>
<p>It was then that I deeply realized that cultivating a habit takes a long time, but breaking it often happens in an instant. Life and love have gradually become more concrete, but the desire to express has become elusive. Fortunately, starting this week, I&rsquo;ll have a more stable life state and pattern, and everything is back on track. So, with this weekly review as a boundary, I&rsquo;m picking up the blank month-plus of life again.</p>
<h2 id="chaoyang-beer-festival">Chaoyang Beer Festival</h2>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/chaoyang_beer_01.jpg" alt="chaoyang_beer_01"></p>
<p>I spent a lot of time in Beijing in September. Besides regular dating on weekends, we also wanted to participate in some fun activities. While ordering at a restaurant, we overheard waiters discussing a beer festival being held in Chaoyang Park. After checking the event details on Xiaohongshu, we decided to go and even prepared homemade sandwiches.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/chaoyang_beer_03.jpg" alt="chaoyang_beer_03"></p>
<p>The scene was very lively. The DJ, dressed like a big guy from the Northwest, spread joy to everyone present, and people started dancing wildly on the lawn. An enthusiastic foreign girl came to greet us, and we even witnessed the entire process of a guy chatting up a girl and getting her contact information, front-row spectators to the scene.</p>
<p>I had two craft beers, not enough to get drunk, but on the slightly tipsy journey home, we opened up and chatted about many interesting things in our lives. When we saw the moon, we would lean on the bridge and look at it for ten or fifteen minutes, competing to see who could come up with more related idioms or poems. It was ordinary, but we enjoyed the long-lost sense of relaxation and simple happiness.</p>
<h2 id="trip-to-inner-mongolia">Trip to Inner Mongolia</h2>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/neimeng_01.jpg" alt="neimeng_01"></p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t really a deliberate arrangement, but by coincidence, our National Day holiday trip was set for Ordos, Inner Mongolia. On one hand, I wanted to see the great desert (something I hadn&rsquo;t seen as a southerner), and on the other hand, it&rsquo;s my girlfriend&rsquo;s hometown, so I thought we could stay for a few days and see where she grew up. In the previous post, I mentioned cutting off my long blue hair due to circumstances, and this was one of those &ldquo;circumstances&rdquo;.</p>
<p>We left at noon, and the three-hour high-speed train journey from Beijing was quite comfortable. I was a bit nervous and at a loss on the way, but I managed to capture a lot of interesting footage with my newly bought Sony ZV1 Mark II (all still on the SD card, haven&rsquo;t had time to sort through it yet - <del>let&rsquo;s focus on getting back to regular weekly reviews before thinking about vlogs</del>). The climate and landscape of Inner Mongolia are indeed quite different from Jiangsu and Zhejiang, dry and windy, but with vast skies and high clouds, possessing a kind of clean beauty.</p>
<p>My girlfriend&rsquo;s parents came to pick us up, and we chatted casually along the way. Because I couldn&rsquo;t quite understand the dialect of Dalate Banner, and they didn&rsquo;t know how to explain some words in Mandarin, and since all four of us were English majors (my girlfriend&rsquo;s parents are English teachers, and although my girlfriend and I later strayed from our major, we also came from English backgrounds), we ended up with the curious scene of using English to explain dialect, leaving us with some interesting memory points.</p>
<p>Knowing I came from the south, they wanted to cater to my tastes, so on the first night, we went to a fishing village to eat Yellow River carp. Over the next few days, we met some relatives and friends, inevitably had a few drinks, but could really feel the warmth and hospitality that went beyond words. We went to the early morning market and ate a lot of beef and mutton and local specialties, which really satisfied my imagination of the Great Northwest.</p>
<p>We returned to Beijing a few days later, happy but indeed a bit tired. Perhaps my homebound self was still a bit drained from meeting so many people and doing so many things at once, but we recorded many interesting things and precious memory moments, so maybe we can look forward to a vlog.</p>
<p><del>In the end, we didn&rsquo;t make it to the great desert. Why did I go to Inner Mongolia again?</del></p>
<h2 id="trip-to-aranya--100-days">Trip to Aranya &amp; 100 Days</h2>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/boyi_anaya_01.png" alt="boyi_anaya_01"></p>
<p>After returning to Beijing and resting for a day, because October 7th happened to be our 100th day together, we drove to Aranya in Qinhuangdao on the 6th. It&rsquo;s an interesting seaside community/resort. I think compared to digital nomad communities like Dali and Chiang Mai, the petite bourgeois atmosphere deliberately created here is stronger. Duplex houses, large lawns in front with families frolicking, occasional people riding bicycles passing by, and foreigners jogging, very cinematic.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/boyi_anaya_02.png" alt="boyi_anaya_02"></p>
<p>The hotel balcony directly overlooks the beach, and it&rsquo;s just a few steps to the internet-famous &ldquo;Aranya Chapel&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lonely Library&rdquo;. However, my girlfriend and I didn&rsquo;t join the crowd for these popular spots. The library might indeed be lonely, but surrounded by tourists lining up to check in and take photos, there was a strange sense of dissonance. However, in today&rsquo;s world, it seems that being &ldquo;photogenic&rdquo; is its greatest value. What attracted us more was a row of swings on the beach, swinging back and forth watching the waves crash against the shore, very leisurely.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/boyi_anaya_03.png" alt="boyi_anaya_03"></p>
<p>Since falling in love, there&rsquo;s been a feeling of both distance and closeness. It seems like we just got together a few days ago, yet it also feels like we&rsquo;ve been together for a very long time. However, 100 days still has some sense of ceremony. My girlfriend secretly bought balloons in advance, and we commemorated with instant photos. Love is really a wonderful thing; even small daily occurrences become especially precious.</p>
<h2 id="chiang-mai-digital-nomads">Chiang Mai Digital Nomads</h2>
<p>I had confirmed long ago that I would go to muChiangmai, a Web3 digital nomad co-living event, as a mentor. For details about the event, you can read my online neighbor ivy&rsquo;s article &ldquo;Coder Migrates to the Ancient City Wall: muChiangmai Memories - ivyheretochill&rdquo;, which gives a detailed account of various experiences over a month. I only stayed for a short week and spent a lot of time in the hotel dealing with work, so I&rsquo;ll share more about life itself. This time, I tried to continuously update small essays on the Telegram channel &ldquo;Yu&rsquo;s Life&rdquo; to avoid forgetting, so I&rsquo;ll compile them here.</p>
<h3 id="arriving-in-chiang-mai---20231008">Arriving in Chiang Mai - 20231008</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/chiangmai_1008.jpg" alt="chiangmai_1008"></p>
<p>After more than three years, I&rsquo;m back in Chiang Mai. Last time was during the pandemic when I was sending Ni to Australia and needed to transit in a third country for 14 days. This time is mainly for a developer event, plus I still have quite a few work tasks, so I don&rsquo;t have any plans for sightseeing. I just packed lightly, carrying only one big bag when I set off.</p>
<p>I chose a midnight flight, arriving in the morning. After visa-free entry, it was very convenient, just passing through with a passport, no additional procedures. After leaving the airport, I took a Bolt taxi to the hotel, checked in, freshened up, took out my laptop, and started working. Since I wasn&rsquo;t very hungry, I only thought about going out for a stroll when it was nearly evening and I had finished the tasks at hand. I&rsquo;m staying near Tha Pae Gate, which is quite lively. I randomly chose a restaurant not too far away for my first meal here, and it was a pleasant surprise.</p>
<p>Actually, compared to holidays with large chunks of time deliberately arranged for travel, I prefer coming to places like Chiang Mai that don&rsquo;t give people too much of a sense of being in a foreign land. There&rsquo;s no need to switch roles or adjust my mindset like on a vacation. During the day, I still stay at home and work like before, and in the evening, if I feel like it, I look for small street-side restaurants to explore food. While changing environments adds some color to life, it also reduces the sense of invasion into life.</p>
<h3 id="kindness-hidden-in-the-corners-of-life---20231009">Kindness Hidden in the Corners of Life - 20231009</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/chaingmai_1009.jpg" alt="chaingmai_1009"></p>
<p>Today I didn&rsquo;t have any extra plans either, just stayed in the hotel working. At noon, I thought I should go out for a stroll, so I chose a local small restaurant called &ldquo;Sailomjoy Restaurant&rdquo;. Based on my impression of Thai food, I ordered stir-fried morning glory and rice noodles, which were delicious. I feel like I&rsquo;ve always had some luck in blindly choosing good food.</p>
<p>The restaurant was quite busy at lunchtime, so I chose a corner seat to sit alone and eat. A guy with a very pure British accent came over with a plate, pointed at the sauce on my table, and said, &ldquo;May I?&rdquo; After adding it, he smiled and said to me, &ldquo;Thank you! Enjoy!&rdquo; My mood instantly lifted.</p>
<p>I remember when I first moved into a small, dark rented room in Hong Kong, I felt very depressed. Every day I would return home late from the library, and I hadn&rsquo;t gotten around to fixing the broken light in the room. I mentioned it to the landlady, and when I returned home that night, I found it fixed, with an apple and a note on the table that read &ldquo;Light fix&rdquo;. It seemed that suddenly, the time in this rented room, along with my entire life, brightened up along with the fixed light.</p>
<p>I also remember attending a concert in Beijing earlier this year. As I was navigating through the crowd to find my seat, a handsome guy said to his companion, &ldquo;I love his hair! It&rsquo;s cool.&rdquo; It seems that foreigners are more willing to express their kindness towards others and the world through their words.</p>
<p>I feel like I&rsquo;ve always liked and appreciated these little moments of happiness hidden in the corners of life. When making personal plans, I also added a point about &ldquo;random kindness&rdquo;, hoping that I can also bring some changes to others, more or less.</p>
<h3 id="memory-randomly-connects---20231010">Memory Randomly Connects - 20231010</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/chiangmai_1010.jpg" alt="chiangmai_1010"></p>
<p>Today was another day where I didn&rsquo;t go out for most of it. Around 4 pm, I was really hungry, and I had a team meeting in the evening, so I went out early to find food. Suddenly I felt like eating Western food, so I chose an Italian restaurant called &ldquo;Pulcinella da Stefano&rdquo; a few hundred meters from the hotel.</p>
<p>After entering, I randomly chose a seat by the side. As I picked up the menu and glanced at it, a strange sense of familiarity came over me. Suddenly I remembered that I might have eaten at this place when I came to Tha Pae Gate three years ago, and I even found the &ldquo;Milan-style braised veal shank&rdquo; that I thought was very novel at the time. Indeed, I was even sitting in the same spot as today. It&rsquo;s quite amazing.</p>
<p>I always thought I had been to many places and changed a lot in these few years, but often there are moments that randomly connect me with memories from the past. Some might be inconspicuous objects or very subtle feelings, but they give me a sense of time flowing slowly.</p>
<p>But really, one shouldn&rsquo;t order food when very hungry. You&rsquo;ll definitely order too much. I&rsquo;ll try to go out for lunch tomorrow.</p>
<h3 id="short-essays-and-compilations---20231011">Short Essays and Compilations - 20231011</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/chiangmai_1012.jpg" alt="chiangmai_1012"></p>
<p>Before the National Day holiday, I put aside the weekly review due to being busy with some work tasks, then went through the holiday, then came to Chiang Mai, and a series of arrangements. When I wanted to write again, I had lost the mood to record at that time, but not updating for so long brought a lot of psychological pressure. It always felt like something was left hanging in my heart, but I didn&rsquo;t want to perfunctorily get it over with.</p>
<p>Actually, the mood to share has a timeliness, just like having an interesting dream right after waking up, it&rsquo;s fleeting. Suddenly I saw @strrlthedev&rsquo;s &ldquo;Gap Year Wrapped - Timeline&rdquo;, and it occurred to me that I could actually record some things every day/period of time, write some short essays, and then do a compiled weekly review on the weekend plus some overall thoughts. This would reduce the pressure of large blocks of time brought by weekly reviews, while also capturing some interesting ideas. Consider the channel as a preview.</p>
<p>By the way, let me add yesterday&rsquo;s record. It was a day of failed attempts to go out and eat normally. I still worked in the hotel, still only ate one meal, but it was still very delicious, called &ldquo;Kat&rsquo;s Kitchen&rdquo;, Thai cuisine.</p>
<h3 id="coworking---20231012">Coworking - 20231012</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/chiangmai_1012_2.jpg" alt="chiangmai_1012_2"></p>
<p>Although the main purpose this time was muChiangmai, it wasn&rsquo;t until the afternoon that I first went to the PunSpace venue. The event organizers and OpenBuild colleagues warmly came to pick me up and tell me about some event matters. It turns out this is that kind of large public space where everyone works together. The network and environment are good, with a strong tech atmosphere. If I had known earlier, I would have come over to play together for the past few days. I feel like work efficiency is quite high, and I even met online neighbors like ivyFanshao and CaptainZ! Happy!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been working remotely for more than half a year now, and although the time arrangement is very free, sometimes when I stay by myself for too long, I fall into a kind of low-pressure state. It&rsquo;s not about emotions, it just seems like my perception of the world is diminished, like the lonely feeling of suddenly waking up from an afternoon nap to find that the sky outside has already darkened. So sometimes I actively seek some changes, like taking an hour-long subway ride every Thursday to Liangzhu Village in Hangzhou to work together with others, or changing environments like this to feel the flow of life.</p>
<p>In the evening, I went to eat at a restaurant I had been to on the first night, &ldquo;Airniversary&rdquo;. Last time I had Thai food, today I tried completely different dishes, steak with Thai sweet and spicy sauce and a super large coconut (strange way of eating), unexpectedly delicious.</p>

<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/chiangmai_1013.jpg" alt="chiangmai_1013"></p>
<p>I woke up from a nightmare at around 5 am today and thought I might as well get up and work. Just then, a colleague in the US saw that I was online and asked me to help solve a bug together. Because I&rsquo;m not very familiar with this repository, it took time to set up the environment and debug. In between, I had a quarterly meeting and did some other work. It dragged on until now before it was truly resolved. Spending a whole day fixing one lousy bug 🤣</p>
<p>I took some time at noon to eat some mango sticky rice, delicious!</p>
<p>A long week has ended, but because there&rsquo;s a urgent project next week, I&rsquo;ll be working overtime on the weekend, catching up on the weekly review, and preparing for Monday&rsquo;s workshop. Busy.</p>
<h3 id="the-lost-book-shop---20231014">The Lost Book Shop - 20231014</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/chiangmai_1014.jpg" alt="chiangmai_1014"></p>
<p>I went to a second-hand bookstore on the street called &ldquo;The Lost Book Shop&rdquo;. True to its name, it&rsquo;s very vintage. The first floor is narrow but orderly, and after climbing a staircase, there&rsquo;s a suddenly spacious second floor. As a Maugham fan, I really love this series&rsquo; cover design and binding. I somewhat regret only bringing a bag and not a suitcase, as I can&rsquo;t carry many things. After much deliberation, besides &ldquo;The Razor&rsquo;s Edge&rdquo;, I chose a few books I haven&rsquo;t read before.</p>

<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/chiangmai_1014_2.jpg" alt="chiangmai_1014_2"></p>
<p>I decided to go out more on the weekend. As a southerner, I really can&rsquo;t resist the temptation of seafood. I found a very local restaurant called &ldquo;Maadae Slow Fish Kitchen&rdquo; on TripAdvisor. The ingredients were very fresh, and the sauces were unique. After eating, I took a walk and went to a second-hand bookstore called &ldquo;The Lost Book Shop&rdquo; and bought some books by Maugham. In the evening, I went to another local restaurant called &ldquo;Nun&rsquo;s Restaurant&rdquo; and had curry noodles. After eating, there was a bit of a downpour, and while taking shelter from the rain in 7-11, I also ordered a pancake from a street food stall, which was a bit sweet but tasted good.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/chiangmai_1014_3.jpg" alt="chiangmai_1014_3"></p>
<p>I guess it started from a Japanese drama mix I saw a long time ago called &ldquo;Eat Well Today Too&rdquo;. Due to my living habits, I can&rsquo;t say I eat regularly, but I have a special sense of ritual towards good food. I will record and feel it.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/chiangmai_1014_4.jpg" alt="chiangmai_1014_4"></p>
<p>&ldquo;Whether in moments of health, illness, satisfaction, or loneliness, please have a good meal. Both body and mind will be healed.&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;Taberu Onna&rdquo; (The Woman Who Eats)</p>

<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/chiangmai_1016.jpg" alt="chiangmai_1016"></p>
<p>I feel like I haven&rsquo;t spoken English for long stretches since graduating from Hong Kong. This time, to challenge myself (and get free accommodation), I applied to be a mentor at the muChiangmai event, mainly to host a two-hour Solidity workshop. But I was so busy last week that I only started preparing on Sunday night. After going out to eat, I came back and slept until one in the morning, got up to revise the PPT + write the demo until about six, slept for a while, then continued revising until the afternoon.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/chiangmai_1016_2.jpg" alt="chiangmai_1016_2"></p>
<p>The workshop was in a small conference room, not many people but it was packed full, the atmosphere was good. I was still very nervous, feeling that my English was still a bit stumbling, but at least I didn&rsquo;t get stuck. I managed to cover everything I wanted to explain and express, so it counts as a small challenge. After it ended, I went to Chiang Mai University night market with some online neighbors, probably had my last meal in Chiang Mai this time, then hurriedly took a Bolt back to the hotel for a team meeting.</p>
<p>I have a flight at 6 am tomorrow morning, planning to go to the airport at night to catch up on the work and weekly review I missed during the day. Goodbye, Chiang Mai.</p>

<h3 id="reuniting-with-old-friends">Reuniting with Old Friends</h3>
<p>Originally, I might have stayed longer in Chiang Mai, but Xiaoyu came back from Japan, only staying for a few days. The last time we met, the pandemic hadn&rsquo;t even started yet. Time really flies. We&rsquo;ve known each other since high school in 2012, and now it&rsquo;s been over ten years of friendship. As we slowly grow up, we have fewer and fewer friends, but those who remain are all the more precious. Even after not seeing each other for years, we hardly feel any estrangement. We ate together, went home to see Nini, talked about many ideas, and also mentioned many small things from the past. It&rsquo;s really nice.</p>
<h3 id="classmates-wedding">Classmate&rsquo;s Wedding</h3>
<p>This is probably the second wedding I&rsquo;ve attended, and also the second time I wasn&rsquo;t chosen as a groomsman due to my long/blue hair, haha. It was my high school deskmate, who has always been a steady and thorough person, and of course, arranged this major life event very meticulously. I took this opportunity to have dinner with my high school male classmates. Because there were very few boys in the liberal arts class, 8 boys and 40 girls, we instead formed a deeper friendship. Until the pandemic, we would gather twice a year after graduation. Even though we&rsquo;re now scattered and drifting, we still maintain some contact. After the wedding, we went to the next event.</p>
<h2 id="life-changes-and-nini">Life Changes and Nini</h2>
<p>Some things happened in the family this week. My grandmother, who is already 80 years old, was hit by a car while walking in our hometown. She stayed in the ICU for eight days. Fortunately, her life wasn&rsquo;t in danger, but she broke more than a dozen ribs, and her lungs were also affected. According to the doctor, she might never be able to stand up again. I spent my childhood in my hometown and grew up around them. In the past two years, I&rsquo;ve experienced my maternal grandmother&rsquo;s passing, as well as various major and minor accidents or illnesses of my grandparents. It seems I&rsquo;ve reached this stage of life now, sad but helpless.</p>
<p>My parents and relatives have been traveling back and forth between Hangzhou and our hometown in Jiangsu, taking turns to care for her in the hospital and discussing future arrangements. Previously, because I was often traveling between two cities, Nini was cared for by my parents and my sister at home. But due to this incident, I didn&rsquo;t want to add to their worries, so I found a familiar pet transportation company and had Nini travel over 1,200 kilometers back to Beijing in a small car. It was just in time as the weather was turning cooler, and any later I would have been more worried about the journey.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/two_cats_in_beijing.jpg" alt="two_cats_in_beijing"></p>
<p>Everything went smoothly and arrived in Beijing. I went to pick her up and bring her home. Because she had stayed at my girlfriend&rsquo;s place for a while before, there wasn&rsquo;t much stress, and after a day or two of adjustment, she gradually became familiar with my girlfriend&rsquo;s little cat, Fanfan. I didn&rsquo;t expect to be able to live this intermittent life with two people and two cats.</p>
<p>Later on, I&rsquo;ll be able to spend more time with Nini again, and I&rsquo;ll share more daily life photos.</p>
<h2 id="life-adjustments-and-state-of-mind">Life Adjustments and State of Mind</h2>
<p>Actually, from late September, I was somewhat dissatisfied with various aspects of myself, even to the point of feeling a bit dejected. I often felt that my work state wasn&rsquo;t good, whether in terms of work efficiency or focus. It took several conversations with my team leader before gradually getting back on track.</p>
<p>In terms of input, there was some stagnation. The list of books, articles, and movies I wanted to read and watch kept getting longer, but I often found it hard to regain that focused state I had before. Sometimes I would even space out for a long time. As for the weekly review, there was actually no shortage of content to write about, but every time I opened the document, I felt a bit anxious. It seemed I hadn&rsquo;t read much, my learning progress wasn&rsquo;t as good as I hoped, and the things I shared felt a bit superficial.</p>
<p>There were many, many negative emotions brought about by anxiety, depression, and insecurity. And I seem to be a person without much emotional outlet, unable to get release from momentary stimulation of the body and brain like sports or games. I could only force myself to continue reading some things, going round in circles. Going to Chiang Mai was more about giving myself an opportunity to adjust my life state rather than attending an event. Although relying on the environment seems to be a rather tricky option, it was indeed effective.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/daily_cook_1107.png" alt="daily_cook_1107"></p>
<p>After coming back, I seem to have regained some motivation. I started going to the gym with my girlfriend twice a week (7 am on weekdays and afternoons on weekends) for personal training sessions. I can feel the improvement in mental state brought about by a healthy body. I also started cooking for myself regularly, finding that I quite enjoy the process of following cooking videos step by step. It seems to have become a special way of relieving stress.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/gxgexiao">Xiao</a> for kindly providing Yangcheng Lake hairy crabs, it was a great extra meal!</p>

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>This piece is a record and reflection of my life from September 13 to September 17, 2023.</p>
<p>On Monday, I went to see the long-awaited &ldquo;Oppenheimer&rdquo; - it had been a while since I last went to the cinema. Saturday was spent sketching at the Old Summer Palace, a fully immersive day. Sunday marked my first boxing class at a boxing gym, quite a novel experience. Midweek, I finally met Atlas and discussed various topics about work and life. My life routine is gradually returning to normal, though there are some issues with my work status that required adjustments. I made a guest appearance for an interview on polebug&rsquo;s channel, discussing many topics related to Web3 and contract development. There were many other interesting happenings as well.</p>
<h2 id="interview">Interview</h2>
<p>I had a chat on <a href="https://twitter.com/polebug">polebug&rsquo;s</a> <a href="https://space.bilibili.com/58078997">Bilibili channel</a> about my previous learning experiences and topics related to Web3 and smart contracts. Before I knew it, we had talked for nearly 30 minutes. It was an interesting conversational experience and also served as a small summary of some of my learning.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="boxing">Boxing</h2>
<p>Long ago, I read about this sport in my senior&rsquo;s article &ldquo;<a href="https://www.boyilu.com/boxing-beginner">Sports | What are some things you only know after learning boxing?</a>&rdquo;. However, as a hardcore homebody, I couldn&rsquo;t even distinguish between Western boxing, Muay Thai, and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, let alone try them. It wasn&rsquo;t until recently when I wanted to find some group activities that I thought of starting with boxing. So, I made an appointment for a weekend afternoon, changed into sports attire, and headed to the boxing gym.</p>
<p>I had rollerbladed for many years before and skateboarded for a while, but had little exposure to other sports. I approached the class with some apprehension. As expected, I struggled with coordinating footwork and punches due to lack of experience with this type of sport. My coordination wasn&rsquo;t great either. I realized I might have been stuck in my own thought patterns for too long - at first, I almost wanted to make a mind map to lay out the sequence of various movements. I felt a bit discouraged when my body and mind weren&rsquo;t in sync, but after a bit of practice, I managed to keep up with the training rhythm.</p>
<p>My senior even recorded a short video of me practicing punches, which I posted in my <a href="https://t.me/pseudoyulife/">channel</a>: <a href="https://t.me/pseudoyulife/2360">https://t.me/pseudoyulife/2360</a></p>
<p>Being able to experience the satisfaction of punching in the first lesson was very rewarding. Overall, it&rsquo;s an interesting and stress-relieving sport, and not as difficult as I had imagined. Many footwork and detailed movements still need more practice, and I want to continue training.</p>
<h2 id="work-status-adjustment">Work Status Adjustment</h2>
<p>My life routine has been gradually returning to normal these past few weeks, which can be seen from the frequency of my weekly reviews. I&rsquo;ve started reading books and watching movies again, finally took the first step towards exercise, and have been slowly participating in some outdoor activities on weekends. My emotions seem to be in a good state.</p>
<p>However, I&rsquo;ve noticed some issues with my work status. It&rsquo;s not about the direction or content of the work, but rather that there are too many things I want to do, and I seem to want to explore them all. But my time and energy are ultimately limited, causing me to lose focus and affecting my efficiency. After talking with my team leader and colleagues, I&rsquo;ve started making some adjustments.</p>
<p>It seems I&rsquo;ve reached another cycle of self-adjustment.</p>
<h2 id="personal-life-snapshots">Personal Life Snapshots</h2>
<h3 id="oppenheimer">Oppenheimer</h3>
<p>Because I subscribe to various streaming services both domestic and foreign, and generally don&rsquo;t follow trending topics, I rarely go to the cinema. After work on Monday, I went to see a movie for the first time in a while - the long-anticipated &ldquo;Oppenheimer&rdquo;. The last memorable experience was the three-hour Batman film, equally long and equally enjoyable.</p>
<p>Nolan&rsquo;s &ldquo;Interstellar&rdquo; and the Batman trilogy are among my favorite films. His pursuit of immersion and control of emotions is well-suited for more profound biographical, historical, and heroic themes. The protagonist is striking yet realistic, and the supporting characters each have their own story arcs. What impressed me most was the deliberately disjointed narrative, the interweaving of black-and-white and color images, and the long dialogues. As a biography, it&rsquo;s hard to expect a clear storyline and developmental rhythm, but the somewhat chaotic and complex imagery constitutes a very &ldquo;Nolan-esque&rdquo; editing style, which allowed me to catch several hidden plot twists and foreshadowing.</p>

<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/boyi_yuanmingyuan_draw.jpg" alt="boyi_yuanmingyuan_draw"></p>
<p>Another fun weekend activity was accompanying my senior to sketch at the Old Summer Palace on Saturday. It was my first time visiting the Old Summer Palace. Although I brought my camera, I didn&rsquo;t take many photos around. However, I did try out the newly purchased Sony ZV1 Mark II, which I intend to use for recording our life together. It&rsquo;s a very compact point-and-shoot camera, with improvements in focal length and usability compared to the ZV1 I used before. I set it to HLG3, consistent with my camera&rsquo;s parameters, so I can shoot some videos with it in the future. Perhaps I&rsquo;ll regularly record some vlogs or something similar.</p>

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>This article is a record and reflection of my life from <code>2023-09-05</code> to <code>2023-09-13</code>. I concentrated on writing a contract project that wasn&rsquo;t particularly complex, and also revisited my learning experience and insights on contract development due to an interview with a content creator friend, continuing to produce my series of tutorials. A publishing house contacted me, and I might start writing a technical book, which I&rsquo;m both looking forward to and feeling a bit anxious about. Due to hair quality issues and some personal reasons, I temporarily cut off my long hair and started growing it again, which is probably the biggest change recently. I wrote an article about building a knowledge system that I really like, rediscovering the most fundamental joy in writing. I&rsquo;m also seeing my weekly review mentioned in more and more blog posts, which makes me happy but also a bit embarrassed, and I&rsquo;ve been rethinking my original intention of writing these reviews. There are many other interesting things as well.</p>
<h2 id="farewell-to-long-hair">Farewell to Long Hair</h2>
<p>Although it might seem a bit sentimental to write a whole theme about getting a haircut, I still have some feelings about it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had long and blue hair for a year now. From the initial slight discomfort to it gradually becoming a kind of symbol of myself in a sense, it has accompanied me for a long time, through several distinctly different life states. At the end of last year, I dyed it blue just because I wanted a change of style, fulfilling my small anime-inspired wish. Coincidentally, just a couple of months later, Beijing went into lockdown due to the pandemic, and I couldn&rsquo;t go out to get a haircut. By the time things truly opened up, it had already grown to a decent length. I bought a few cool headbands and decided to just keep it long. That was a year ago.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting how when your appearance leaves a noticeable impression on people, your inner self seems to have fewer constraints and concerns. I found myself chatting with a Middle Eastern investor who was interested in my headband all the way through the Web3 Festival in Hong Kong; I had people from other booths approach me saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve noticed you for a while, you&rsquo;re very eye-catching&rdquo;; I was recognized by a high school classmate who&rsquo;s also in Web3, whom I hadn&rsquo;t been in contact with for nearly ten years - it was surprising but also delightful. Perhaps I always had the desire to share and communicate, but was hesitant due to some social anxiety and concerns about others&rsquo; reactions. My hairstyle and color gave me some courage to expose myself in crowds, like a kind of protective coloration.</p>
<p>As the color had faded quite a bit, and my hair had become somewhat frizzy due to damage from bleaching several times, and also because I have an important occasion at the end of the month, I made up my mind to cut off the long hair first and grow it out again for a while. I acted on this idea the very next day. After cutting it, I didn&rsquo;t feel as uncomfortable as I had imagined. Instead, I felt somewhat relieved. Perhaps this year brought not only changes in hair length, but also gradual changes in my mindset. I&rsquo;ve gained more courage to face the world.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, STRRL also cut off his long hair, which he had been growing for two years, around the same time. <del>Liangzhu Village has lost two long-haired boys</del>.</p>
<h2 id="the-original-intention-of-weekly-reviews">The Original Intention of Weekly Reviews</h2>
<p>During the week, I published an article &ldquo;<a href="https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2023/09/05/my_personal_pkm_input_output_system/">Personal Information Acquisition and Knowledge Management System (Heptabase + Logseq + Readwise)</a>&rdquo;. A few hours of writing turned a derivative idea from a weekly review into a reasonably structured article. It had been a long time since I had created something so effortlessly and enjoyably.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve accumulated more and more topics I want to write about, and for most of them, I already have enough material to start writing. But I often hesitate, feeling that I&rsquo;m &ldquo;not qualified&rdquo; to convey and evaluate. Take this article about the knowledge system, for example. I&rsquo;ve only been paying for Heptabase for about two weeks, and even less for Readwise. In terms of functionality, I&rsquo;m not particularly familiar with all the modules. But when I started writing, it seemed that my years of thinking and practice about this system all transformed into paragraphs of text. I wrote so much without realizing it, which was a wonderful feeling. So perhaps what&rsquo;s important is still independent thinking and writing it down, rather than needing to match the comprehensiveness of textbooks or documentation.</p>
<p>Only the weekly review is a dialogue with my future self, and I always feel relaxed when writing it. After all, I&rsquo;m the most qualified person to record and examine myself.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/weekly_review_hu_mention.jpg" alt="weekly_review_hu_mention"></p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/weekly_review_hu_comment.jpg" alt="weekly_review_hu_comment"></p>
<p>This week, I saw mentions of how my weekly review format has influenced several friends in their own reviews. While I&rsquo;m happy about this, I also feel a bit guilty. It seems I haven&rsquo;t been publishing on time for a long time (<del>even this one</del>). Even after delaying for a long time, the finished product still feels rushed. After publishing, I often remember some interesting things I forgot to mention, and think, I&rsquo;ll mention it next time. And so it goes on.</p>
<p>Life is full of little everyday moments. Just like how I like to use my camera to capture small scenes on the street, words are my viewfinder for facing this world. I hope I can leave more behind, and more vividly. It seems that only in this way can those memories and beautiful things be preserved more.</p>
<h2 id="reading-and-book-notes">Reading and Book Notes</h2>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/notes_about_how_to_writing.png" alt="notes_about_how_to_writing"></p>
<p>This week, I came across an interesting article &ldquo;<a href="https://hanyang.wtf/p/c7a">Introduction to Writing</a>&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s about some principles of writing shared by the author who recently wrote a viral research report about Binance. In fact, I often don&rsquo;t pay much attention to the &ldquo;techniques&rdquo; in photography and writing, usually following my own feelings and so-called aesthetics. But I often worry that my lack of expressive power might prevent me from recording my inner thoughts and what I want to express. So this article is quite interesting. I made some notes while reading and synchronized them to Logseq.</p>

I learned a lot about concepts related to stocks, funds, and indices that were previously a bit vague to me, and also gained some understanding of investment principles and strategies.

<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/yu_blog_my_pkm_system.png" alt="yu_blog_my_pkm_system"></p>
<p>I seem to have always had a tendency to view myself as a machine, often observing myself from an outsider&rsquo;s perspective, integrating various modules, and constantly tinkering and optimizing. When a certain behavioral pattern or habit I&rsquo;ve built suddenly proves useful at a particular moment, I feel a sense of delight. Conversely, when external influences or my own state disrupt the system, I experience a profound discomfort from the breakdown of order.</p>
<p>As an efficiency tool enthusiast, my personal knowledge management and information management can be said to be the most important part of myself. I actually had no intention of writing this article, as there are too many precedents and practices before me, and I&rsquo;m only making minor adjustments and optimizations based on the work of others. I often lack the confidence to share, but this week I rebuilt and optimized my knowledge management system, and I&rsquo;m very happy about it. I had an urge to document it, and although I initially intended to just mention it briefly in my weekly review, I found myself unable to stop writing. Thus, this article came into being.</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;ve often mentioned information output in my weekly reports before, so this article will also cover some previous content and finally supplement the parts about information acquisition and knowledge management. It will serve as a comprehensive collection. Regarding the theoretical aspects, such as the &ldquo;Feynman Learning Technique&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Luhmann&rsquo;s Zettelkasten Method,&rdquo; there are already many excellent introductory articles, so I won&rsquo;t spend space introducing them here. Instead, I will focus more on describing the software tools I use in practice, hoping it will be helpful to everyone.</p>
<h2 id="information-acquisition-and-management">Information Acquisition and Management</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure when it started, but I can clearly feel my dependence on information from the online world. Perhaps unlike gaming addiction or the oft-criticized short video algorithm &ldquo;opium,&rdquo; my dependence is not mechanical scrolling or an escape from anxiety, but a craving for information acquisition that has even internalized into a way of life. Because I have confidence in my ability to filter and digest information, I haven&rsquo;t actually spent much effort on input sources and organization.</p>
<p>However, as I&rsquo;ve come into contact with and become interested in more and more fields, information has continuously accumulated. Sometimes, just browsing and reading through it all has exceeded my memory capacity. Often, this information is scattered in my notes or in some corner of my mind, and has not become an internalized part of me. It&rsquo;s also difficult to recall or retrieve later. So, I&rsquo;ve re-examined my method of information acquisition.</p>
<h3 id="information-source-classification">Information Source Classification</h3>
<p>My sources of information can be broadly categorized as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Random thoughts</li>
<li>Information flow</li>
<li>Focused reading</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="random-thoughts">Random Thoughts</h4>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/logseq_random_thoughts.png" alt="logseq_random_thoughts"></p>
<p>In daily life, work, study, or at any random moment, I sometimes have random thoughts that are unrelated to what I&rsquo;m currently doing or are flights of fancy, but might be useful at some point in the future. Since I&rsquo;m rarely far from my computer for most of the time, I usually record these in Logseq&rsquo;s Journal. Sometimes I might temporarily send them to a WeChat group with only myself in it or to Telegram&rsquo;s Saved Messages, and later add them to Logseq.</p>
<h4 id="information-flow">Information Flow</h4>
<p>From the moment I wake up every day, I&rsquo;m enveloped by information flows from various platforms. Relying on the online world inevitably involves struggling with social media and algorithms. On one hand, we need to avoid being troubled by excessive anxiety-inducing information or the &ldquo;Peer Pressure&rdquo; from our social circles. On the other hand, we also need to be wary of the information cocoons constructed by algorithms. To be honest, this is quite difficult to achieve. Even though I more or less have some ability to restrain myself and filter information, and am consciously trying to do so, it&rsquo;s still hard to avoid having my thoughts disturbed or guided by it.</p>
<p>I eventually adopted a simple yet effective approach - turning off the WeChat Moments entrance and most app notifications, and limiting the number of follows on platforms that are primarily for information acquisition rather than social interaction (such as Bilibili, Weibo, etc.) to within 100. If I add new ones, I filter and optimize the previous follows to reduce irrelevant content interference. Based on these actions, I use RSS subscriptions, which might seem a bit old-fashioned, but I only subscribe to fewer than 50 websites, most of which are blogs or personal websites, and I regularly filter them to reduce my daily feeds. However, I scan the titles or briefly browse almost all the articles in this feeds list.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/readwise_reader_feeds.png" alt="readwise_reader_feeds"></p>
<p>Initially, I set up my own Miniflux service to fetch this, and used an <a href="https://github.com/Rongronggg9/RSS-to-Telegram-Bot">RSS-to-Telegram-Bot</a> to push notifications. Recently, after starting to use <a href="https://read.readwise.io/">Readwise Reader</a> and finding the experience very good, I migrated this part over. I use a management mode built into Readwise Reader, divided into three categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>Later</li>
<li>Shortlist</li>
<li>Archive</li>
</ol>
<p>I scan the Feeds panel every day, and add interesting articles to Later as a read-it-later list. Of course, from past experience, items in read-it-later lists often become &ldquo;never read later&rdquo; if left for too long. So, I&rsquo;m very restrained when filtering, only adding articles I&rsquo;m very interested in and will read immediately when I have time, and requiring myself to clear the Later list in the evening.</p>
<p>We also get pushed information from various corners of social media and the internet, among which I&rsquo;m particularly concerned about these categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>Interesting viewpoints/tweet threads</li>
<li>Articles of interest</li>
<li>Useful resources</li>
</ol>
<p>If it&rsquo;s some interesting viewpoints or comments, I usually don&rsquo;t add them to the corresponding List, Favorites, etc. of the software, but instead copy their content to Logseq&rsquo;s Journal and tag them accordingly. Actually, many softwares (including Readwise Reader) provide ways to save tweet threads or other convenient methods to save tweets, but I prefer to copy and organize them myself, recording them in a few sentences rather than just saving a link. This seemingly deliberate increase in steps allows me to review these viewpoints one more time, avoiding being influenced by strongly guided or emotional viewpoints, and is more conducive to digesting information and internalizing it into my own thoughts.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/readwise_chrome_extension.png" alt="readwise_chrome_extension"></p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s some articles I&rsquo;m interested in, I read or save them using Readwise&rsquo;s Chrome extension. For this part, I require myself to tag and add notes to every article, with the notes mainly describing why I want to read this article.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/readwise_chrome_extension_highlight.png" alt="readwise_chrome_extension_highlight"></p>
<p>Among these, if it&rsquo;s just articles that need to be skimmed or for information gathering, I add them to the Later list. For in-depth reading, I add them to the Shortlist, and must highlight some meaningful parts, and try to add my own comments and thoughts to the highlights. All of this can be done directly in the plugin, which is very convenient.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/pinboard_bookmark.png" alt="pinboard_bookmark"></p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s some useful websites, documents, code, software or other resource-type information, I use <a href="https://pinboard.in/">Pinboard</a>, a very old but useful bookmark management tool to save them. Similarly, I use a browser extension to save them, and also add tags and brief descriptions. In about a year, I&rsquo;ve accumulated 455 bookmarks, most of which I can quickly retrieve through tags and names when I need to use them.</p>
<p>For video sites and the like, I mostly use likes or favorites, on one hand to show support for the creators, and on the other hand to sync them to my personal Telegram channel &ldquo;<a href="https://t.me/pseudoyulife">Yu&rsquo;s Life</a>&rdquo; through some automation tools, and mark them with corresponding tags. However, most videos are not very information-efficient, so they are more for interesting or exploratory content.</p>
<h4 id="focused-reading">Focused Reading</h4>
<p>Apart from these passively pushed information flows mentioned above, we also have many specific topic or field-related information needs that require us to actively read some books, reports, etc.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/wechat_reader_sync_readwise.png" alt="wechat_reader_sync_readwise"></p>
<p>For this part, I originally used Kindle or read physical books more, and manually made some records in Logseq. But after <a href="https://lutaonan.com/">Randy</a> launched the <a href="https://notepal.randynamic.org/">Notepal</a> tool, I started using WeChat Reading. It has many readable book resources, and I also use it to import books in mobi or epub format. The reading experience is quite good.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/wechat_reader_to_readwise.png" alt="wechat_reader_to_readwise"></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also very convenient to make some notes and annotations. Due to cross-platform synchronization, it&rsquo;s easy to periodically sync to Readwise through the Notepal browser extension, and the effect is also very good (the above image is synced over). This also provides more motivation to read some books in fragmented time.</p>
<h3 id="information-management">Information Management</h3>
<p>In the previous section, I sorted out some channels and systems for information acquisition, but these are still scattered information. To make them part of our own knowledge and thinking, we still need more processes of organization, digestion, and precipitation. But with so many platforms involved, searching and organizing is not convenient, and it&rsquo;s also quite difficult to establish associations between information. Inspired by the book &ldquo;Building a Second Brain&rdquo; that I&rsquo;m currently reading, I mainly did the following two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Borrowed and modified P.A.R.A as my global Tag classification system</li>
<li>Built a Second Brain using Logseq and Heptabase</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="global-tag-system">Global Tag System</h4>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/pama_framework.jpg" alt="pama_framework"></p>
<p>P.A.R.A is a framework proposed by the author, which stands for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Projects, related to ongoing projects</li>
<li>Areas, specific domains</li>
<li>Resources, resources that might be used in the future</li>
<li>Archives, completed projects</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on these four types, I added a &ldquo;Thoughts&rdquo; to categorize some of my random ideas.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/logseq_tag_system.png" alt="logseq_tag_system"></p>
<p>My implementation idea is to use these five types as my global first-level Tags, while more specific projects, domains, industries can be used as second-level, third-level Tags, such as <code>Projects/writing/pkm</code>, <code>Areas/blockchain</code>, <code>Thoughts/weekly-review</code>, etc. Logseq provides a very powerful multi-layer Tag system, which automatically layers according to <code>/</code>, facilitating retrieval and making classification clear at a glance. After modifying some of my existing Tags, the effect is as follows:</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/para_logseq_graph.png" alt="para_logseq_graph"></p>
<h4 id="second-brain-based-on-heptabase--logseq">Second Brain Based on Heptabase + Logseq</h4>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Logseq as my knowledge management system all along. Recently, I saw that <a href="https://twitter.com/WuPingJu">P.J. Wu</a> joined Heptabase, and learned more about this platform, so I incorporated it into my knowledge management system, using it together with Logseq to build my second brain. As long as we follow the Tag system mentioned above, the two platforms don&rsquo;t need additional associations to manage information independently.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/logseq_sync_readwise_sample_page.png" alt="logseq_sync_readwise_sample_page"></p>
<p>Among them, Logseq, as a note-taking system that combines simple task management and bidirectional links, is very suitable for precipitating these information flows and some initial ideas produced after my reading, such as highlights and comment notes. Since Logseq has an official Readwise plugin, it&rsquo;s very convenient to automatically synchronize my highlights and notes from WeChat Reading and online articles as Logseq pages, and associate them with Journal through time. This way, I can intuitively see my past readings and thoughts when I write some reviews every day/week. For example, the above text is some highlights and notes I made using the Readwise Chrome extension on his website while reading <a href="https://twitter.com/MapleShadow">Justin Yan&rsquo;s</a> article &ldquo;<a href="https://justinyan.me/post/5790">Everyone has only 24 hours a day, I hope my choices are really my choices</a>&rdquo;, which was automatically synchronized to Logseq, and tagged with some tags and properties according to my configuration.</p>
<p>Logseq is very suitable for information organization and review, but when I need to research a certain field/concept, organize the context of reading books, or output a blog post, it seems a bit thin. Its information is scattered in each day&rsquo;s Journal in units of blocks, associated and jumped through bidirectional links or tags, which is not convenient for some direct visual association, and also requires oneself to be clear enough about keywords and tags in the early stage, still having some cognitive burden. So for this part, I use Heptabase for management.</p>
<p>Heptabase can be seen as a fully functional whiteboard note-taking tool. <a href="https://twitter.com/WuPingJu">P.J. Wu</a> has many <a href="https://pinchlime.com/tags/heptabase/">high-quality introductory articles</a> about Heptabase, which you can read to learn more. In simple terms, it is mainly divided into the following three levels:</p>
<ul>
<li>Map</li>
<li>Whiteboard</li>
<li>Card</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/heptabase_map_overview.png" alt="heptabase_map_overview"></p>
<p>Among them, Map can be seen as the entire space of our Second Brain, which can contain various whiteboards. I created five whiteboards as the first-level Tags.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/heptabase_whiteboard_overview.png" alt="heptabase_whiteboard_overview"></p>
<p>Cards represent individual ideas or independent information points in our brains. We can organize our knowledge through the association between cards and the hierarchy between whiteboards and cards.</p>
<p>When I was writing the tutorial for the Foundry smart contract development framework, I first laid out some scattered knowledge points or experiences and lessons encountered in practice as individual whiteboards on the Foundry whiteboard (which is the fourth-level sub-whiteboard under <code>Projects</code> - <code>Blockchain</code> - <code>Smart Contract</code>). When a certain knowledge point is sufficient, I would make some Section groupings and line connections between whiteboards.</p>
<p>It also provides native integration with Readwise, allowing us to directly select some highlights and notes from certain articles or books in Readwise as cards and introduce them into the whiteboard in the right sidebar, establishing some associations for them. It&rsquo;s very similar to the process of our brain organizing scattered information or brainstorming, perfectly meeting my needs.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/heptabase_chiangmai_trip.png" alt="heptabase_chiangmai_trip"></p>
<p>I currently also use it to make some travel guides, putting information points from Xiaohongshu and other people&rsquo;s strategy posts as individual cards on the travel planning whiteboard, and then organizing them through associations and groupings, which is very neat.</p>
<h2 id="information-output">Information Output</h2>
<p>My output mainly includes the following parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Notes/Viewpoints/Daily Life</li>
<li>Long Articles</li>
<li>Thematic Research</li>
<li>Information Flow</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="notesviewpointsdaily-life">Notes/Viewpoints/Daily Life</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/yu_twitter_profile.png" alt="yu_twitter_profile"></p>
<p>Among them, Twitter &ldquo;<a href="https://twitter.com/pseudo_yu">pseudo_yu</a>&rdquo; is my main channel for unstructured information output. Sometimes it&rsquo;s some ideas about new technology, feelings about work, emotions about meeting friends, or a cute cat picture, all of which constitute my output and also correspond to the quick production of those random thoughts in my input.</p>
<p>The friends I met on Twitter have also brought me a lot of warmth.</p>
<h3 id="long-articles">Long Articles</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/yu_blog_homepage.png" alt="yu_blog_homepage"></p>
<p>My most important output platform is my personal blog &ldquo;<a href="https://www.pseudoyu.com/">Pseudoyu</a>&rdquo;. Currently, the weekly review is my main outlet, and occasionally there are also some themed or special blog posts about technology or productivity tools.</p>
<h3 id="thematic-research">Thematic Research</h3>
<p>Outputting a blog post, due to considerations of audience, wording, expression, and completeness, actually has a certain cognitive burden and a longer cycle. In the process of conducting thematic research in specific fields, I mostly put learning materials and some demos in GitHub repositories or in some corner of Logseq notes. Sometimes, after a long time, I have to relearn them. Now I put them more in a whiteboard in Heptabase, which can store many small knowledge points and further summarize and refine them in subsequent creations. So I can actually share this whiteboard after it has a basic framework, which allows for more communication with others and can also be helpful to friends who are learning the same thing.</p>
<h3 id="information-flow-output">Information Flow Output</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/yu_telegram_channel_screenshot.png" alt="yu_telegram_channel_screenshot"></p>
<p>I set up my own n8n synchronization service to collect my scattered information input and output on various platforms, and I also post my thoughts on movies, books, and other thoughts in my Telegram channel &ldquo;<a href="https://t.me/pseudoyulife">Yu&rsquo;s Life</a>&rdquo;. I also follow some channels and groups to get some information or meet like-minded people, and occasionally forward manually. The main platforms I synchronize are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blog, which now looks more like a life log.</li>
<li>YouTube, I&rsquo;m also a heavy user, watching a lot of technical tutorials and digital information, and occasionally there&rsquo;s a lot of interesting content.</li>
<li>Bilibili, mainly retaining some bloggers I&rsquo;ve been following for many years, watching travel vlogs more, only viewing dynamics and not the homepage or hot topics.</li>
<li>Pinboard, a bookmark and website saving management tool, which I heavily rely on.</li>
<li>Instapaper, managing read-it-later items, mainly saving some high-quality or long articles.</li>
<li>GitHub, also browsing daily, looking at some good projects, and managing Stars with lists.</li>
<li>Spotify, marking good songs.</li>
<li>Douban, recording my books, TV series, movies, anime, and games. I&rsquo;m also a heavy user, and I&rsquo;m trying to write my own review for every work I&rsquo;ve watched/played.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="data-backup">Data Backup</h2>
<p>Although platforms like Twitter and Telegram are already quite large, they are still centralized products. Plus, with all the recent turmoil, I&rsquo;m always uneasy about using Telegram as the final station for aggregating these information sources, especially since I often almost accidentally click to delete all messages when deleting messages (strange interaction experience). Therefore, the synchronization and export of information is also a very important part. I use the <a href="https://xlog.app/">xLog</a> and <a href="https://xsync.app/">xSync</a> services under the Crossbell ecosystem for on-chain backup of my blog and information from various platforms.</p>
<h3 id="xlog">xLog</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/yu_xlog_profilea6f9af1d5482abc7.png" alt="yu_xlog_profile"></p>
<p>The visual effect and experience are quite good, and it&rsquo;s easy to follow and comment based on the Crossbell address. It includes features like NFT showcase and personal portfolio. This is my <a href="https://xlog.pseudoyu.com/">xLog access address</a>, interested friends can also follow. However, currently, considering the degree of customization, various historical article migration routing issues, changes in my own data statistics services, etc., it&rsquo;s still more of a synchronization distribution channel.</p>
<h3 id="xsync">xSync</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/yu_sync_profile.png" alt="yu_sync_profile"></p>
<p>xSync can synchronize platforms like Twitter, Telegram Channel, etc. Without any invasive modifications, it can make a second backup and archive of my aggregated channel. In the future, I can view my various messages through xChar, which is a perfect solution. This is my xChar personal homepage: <a href="https://xchar.app/pseudoyu">xChar</a>, and you can also view my information flow through <a href="https://xfeed.app/u/pseudoyu">xFeed</a>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>it is probably a mistake, in the end, to ask software to improve our thinking.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/casey-newton">Casey Newton</a> said so in a recent article &ldquo;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/25/23845590/note-taking-apps-ai-chat-distractions-notion-roam-mem-obsidian">Why note-taking apps don&rsquo;t make us smarter</a>&rdquo;. Indeed, these systems or software tools can ultimately only assist us in information management and output, and cannot replace our thinking. However, building a knowledge management system, while pleasing ourselves, can also make thinking more efficient. Pleasing oneself is the way to reach others, thereby producing more valuable output.</p>
<p>I hope this article can be helpful to everyone.</p>

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>This piece is a record and reflection of my life from August 16 to September 4, 2023.</p>
<p>Time has flown by, and two to three weeks have passed unnoticed. I comfort myself by saying that shifting each post forward by a week will soon restore the weekly updates. However, these weeks have not been idle. I&rsquo;ve read some books, perused several articles that greatly impacted me, participated in some interesting activities, tinkered with many intriguing things, rebuilt my knowledge management system, and made orderly progress in both my main work and additional interests. There have been many interesting developments.</p>
<h2 id="personal-information-acquisition-and-knowledge-management-system">Personal Information Acquisition and Knowledge Management System</h2>
<p>Since my post &ldquo;Weekly Review #25 - Personal Information Output and Synchronization System Based on Crossbell (Reconstruction)&rdquo;, I&rsquo;ve been quite satisfied with my information output synchronization system. It has been able to drive input through output, thereby increasing the process of information filtering and reflection. However, as mentioned in that post, I only streamlined and filtered information sources, coupled with a simple tag system and limited bidirectional links. I hadn&rsquo;t really done much digestion and reflection on the input information. When writing weekly reviews or articles, I often recalled based on titles. Due to the reflection I usually did while reading, it wasn&rsquo;t too strenuous.</p>
<p>However, as I picked up many previously interesting directions and goals, the time and energy costs for processing and digesting this information have increased. Coincidentally, I saw that P.J. Wu had joined Heptabase, which led me to revisit his article &ldquo;My Personal Knowledge Management System&rdquo; from a few months ago, as well as Indigo&rsquo;s &ldquo;Feynman Learning Method in Practice / INDIGO&rsquo;s Information Acquisition and Knowledge Output Methodology&rdquo;. This inspired me to reconstruct my knowledge management system, especially on the input side.</p>
<p>The final result is very satisfying. I initially wanted to write some specific details here, but as I wrote, it became increasingly expansive. So I&rsquo;ve separated it into another article, &ldquo;Personal Information Acquisition and Knowledge Management System (Heptabase + Logseq + Readwise)&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="the-meaning-of-choice">The Meaning of Choice</h2>
<p>These days, I read an article by Justin Yan titled &ldquo;Everyone Only Has 24 Hours a Day, I Hope My Choices Are Really My Choices&rdquo;. It mentions several times the concept of &ldquo;exploring inward, finding what you want&rdquo;. This reminded me of the concept of &ldquo;introspection and external seeking&rdquo; that I had previously pondered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As humans, our focus is often divided between internal and external aspects. Comparatively, external focus tends to dominate due to its stimulating nature and positive feedback, while internal focus is often easily overlooked.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>External seeking always seems to have some answers, while introspection has no endpoint. But internal seeking is always accompanied by self-analysis and harm, a behavior that is more contrary to self-protection instincts and human nature. I used to fear this and worry about never finding meaning and falling into an abyss. But now it seems that as long as one is still questioning and thinking, everything still has meaning. Conversely, losing one&rsquo;s inner core, losing the curiosity and drive to explore oneself, is what&rsquo;s truly frightening and unbearable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This way of peeping at other people&rsquo;s lives through the small holes of social networks easily magnifies others&rsquo; real experiences.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I also saw a description of magnifying others, which is very real. This isn&rsquo;t just true for networks. For a long time in university and afterwards, I tended to choose someone I admired at the time to catch up with, always feeling that they had what I desperately wanted. But after truly &ldquo;surpassing&rdquo; them, I realized it was all meaningless. What I was chasing was merely a magnified shadow. To fill this void, I had to choose again. Becoming someone else is ultimately a shortcut and laziness, and often takes you further away from who you truly want to become.</p>
<h2 id="reading-and-book-notes">Reading and Book Notes</h2>
<p>This week, I started reading and writing more. The main book I&rsquo;m reading is &ldquo;Building a Second Brain&rdquo; by Tiago Forte, and I&rsquo;ve also read many articles. Actually, I didn&rsquo;t used to focus much on taking reading notes. I mostly relied on digesting information while reading, forming my own internal thoughts. The advantage of this method is that it makes me more focused when reading and increases absorption efficiency. However, I&rsquo;ve been neglecting the review and internalization part. As time passes, it becomes less easy to remember. Now I use WeChat Reading + Notepal + Readwise to record my highlights and corresponding thoughts. At the same time, in Heptabase and Logseq, each book has a corresponding page for writing some more general or scattered related thoughts. Because it&rsquo;s a card mechanism, it&rsquo;s also convenient to retrieve and associate these note fragments.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;When you&rsquo;re preparing to learn new knowledge, you must stand in the position of the instructor, assuming you&rsquo;re going to explain this knowledge to others.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Learning to output encourages our brains to use the second mode more: &ldquo;Forcibly establishing connections between different concepts is also a specialty of the brain.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been concentrating on reading about information acquisition and knowledge management, which has reinforced the concept of the Feynman learning method. This aligns closely with my approach of using output to drive input, which has indeed been a very useful method. It wasn&rsquo;t until after seeing the concept that I realized I was actually practicing this concept.</p>
<p>In the current era, we&rsquo;ve long since reached information overload. Logseq&rsquo;s bidirectional links, P.A.R.A. theory, and Heptabase&rsquo;s whiteboard are all trying to follow some of the brain&rsquo;s thinking logic to achieve this. My practice is to create scattered card information from different concepts and information points, accumulate enough to modularize and organize frameworks from these information points, and start creating articles when the framework is clear enough. In the process of creating articles, I also review this knowledge and the connections between them, not only for current memory but also for future recall. As a description of note-taking that I really like says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note taking is building a relationship with a future version of yourself.</p>

<p>I spent the Qixi Festival in Beijing. Due to being a bit busy, we didn&rsquo;t go out to eat. My girlfriend made a simple meal, adding a little ritual to life. Then I set up Apple TV + Surge tvOS client for her, so we can watch YouTube and Netflix directly on the TV. We were very happy!</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/hangzhou_rust_meetup.jpg" alt="hangzhou_rust_meetup"></p>
<p>After staying for a week, I hurriedly returned to Hangzhou to attend a Rust event organized by a friend. I seem to have gotten a bit used to traveling back and forth to Beijing, and have started living a &ldquo;tale of two cities&rdquo; life. Emotionally, I&rsquo;ve also relaxed a lot more, and am more willing to participate in various fun activities and try new things.</p>
<p>During the week, I went to Liangzhu for remote work with everyone. I met STRRL, Tuoding, Zhizi, and others. I regret a bit not renting a house there, it was too much fun!</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/love_charge_base.jpg" alt="love_charge_base"></p>
<p>I received my girlfriend&rsquo;s Qixi gift only after arriving in Hangzhou, a super cool transparent power bank. I even brought it to show off (<del>brag</del>) to everyone when I went for remote work, haha. It felt like the childhood feeling of finally receiving a beloved toy.</p>

<p>My sister, who is currently on summer vacation, wanted to play with Nie Nie, so I didn&rsquo;t bring her home that early. After coming back, she&rsquo;s still very clingy. As I write this, I suddenly realized that Nie Nie has been with me for over 10 months now. Time flies so fast, she&rsquo;s already over a year old, shedding some of her childishness. But time also passes slowly; it seems like yesterday when she was hiding in the cabinet, afraid to come out when I first brought her home. The days we&rsquo;ve spent together have been slow, quiet, and beautiful.</p>

<p>I applied to be a mentor for the MuChiangMai event. I can exchange teaching three workshop sessions for free accommodation! I&rsquo;ll probably go to Chiang Mai to be a digital nomad for a few weeks in October. While I&rsquo;m looking forward to it, I&rsquo;m still a bit nervous about teaching in all English. I need to prepare in advance, it&rsquo;s a new challenge.</p>

<p><strong>The Long Season</strong>, supplementary tag. I watched this a long time ago. Chinese dramas often exceed my expectations. The plot rhythm and emotional tension were quite sufficient. I watched it in one go and still wanted more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Disguiser</strong>, I occasionally come across some mixed cuts on Bilibili. Because I like the cast of Nirvana in Fire so much, I intended to play it as background music for a few weekends, but was deeply attracted by the plot. I actually quite like that era and this theme. It has a bit of the feeling of &ldquo;The Invisible Guardian&rdquo; that I played a long time ago, but obviously I still prefer the settings and personalities of Zhuang Xiaoman in the game and Yu Manli in the drama, so I felt quite heartbroken and regretful towards the end.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The World&rsquo;s #1 Web Celebrity</strong>, I recently set up Netflix to watch directly on Apple TV. I randomly clicked on this popular show while tinkering and eating. The female lead&rsquo;s style and outfits are really nice, everything else is quite bad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inside Bill&rsquo;s Brain: Decoding Bill Gates</strong>, I resumed my habit of watching documentaries during lunch. I randomly opened this, originally thinking it would talk about his glorious history and Microsoft empire. However, it talked a lot about poverty, charity, broken friendships, daily life. I was quite surprised to see this side. Overall, it&rsquo;s quite worth watching.</p>

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>This piece is a record and reflection of my life from <code>2023-07-11</code> to <code>2023-08-15</code>.</p>
<p>After nearly a month of stagnation, reopening the weekly review document felt somewhat unfamiliar. In truth, many themes I wanted to write about had accumulated, and there were many words I wished to say. Although my output has decreased, my desire to share has not diminished due to changes in my life state. Instead, it has spread into the quiet flow of daily life. As I gradually became accustomed to the new rhythm of life, I also began to adjust (and fill in) some of the plans I had made at the beginning of the year. Weekly reviews and blog posts have also resumed updating.</p>
<h2 id="the-silent-workers">The Silent Workers</h2>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/yixi_ticket.jpg" alt="yixi_ticket"></p>
<p>One weekend, I went to listen to a Yixi lecture, which is somewhat like a localized version of TED. There were many interesting people there, including an adorable scholar who had lived in Russian forests for years to save endangered owls, an artist exploring the remnants of ancient temples in the folds of mountains and rivers, and an architect who makes his own books&hellip;</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/yixi_speech.jpg" alt="yixi_speech"></p>
<p>The one that left the deepest impression and that I liked the most was a psychologist named Wei Mingyi, who focuses on &ldquo;seeking brevity&rdquo;. I bought her book on the spot and got it signed by the author, and I finished reading it quite intensively this week. I really like her self-description as an &ldquo;apprentice of anthropology&rdquo;, delving deep into a group of workers who were expelled and confined by the glorious era of the Keelung Port in Taiwan, accompanying them, understanding their inner world and life perspective. The book doesn&rsquo;t actually dwell much on depicting hardships. They had their glorious times and experienced the decline of being abandoned by the era, still far from many truly impoverished groups.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/book_with_sig.jpg" alt="book_with_sig"></p>
<p>What&rsquo;s shocking is that this group of people seemed to be quickly forgotten in just a few years due to some changes in political and economic directions. It&rsquo;s as if that period of the &ldquo;sleepless city&rdquo; never belonged to them, yet they have to spend most of their lives making society accept them again. At the same time, they also have to re-recognize themselves. To the outside world, they seem to be a group of &ldquo;useless&rdquo; people who were abandoned for &ldquo;not working hard enough&rdquo;. No one has ever seriously listened to their voices, and they have gradually learned to be silent.</p>
<p>History always decides what should be recorded according to its own (or some political) standards. They are the brushstrokes that have been overlooked, yet the true sense of history often lies beyond historical records, in those buried memories. Our current era is the same, with too many things that cannot be spoken of or discussed. Those are precisely the true voices of the era.</p>
<p>The writing style reminds me of a Taiwanese film I watched before, &ldquo;A Sun&rdquo;. Many dialogues, monologues, and long shots seem to present many traces of life as they are, probably a unique style of Taiwan, narrating slowly. I&rsquo;ve become very interested in some Taiwanese lifestyles and era characteristics, and next I want to watch a drama I&rsquo;ve wanted to see for a long time, &ldquo;Workers&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m particularly interested in this point because during my junior and senior high school years, due to my father&rsquo;s work, I had the experience of living in employee dormitories with some of his apprentices. At that time, most of my roommate brothers hadn&rsquo;t finished or hadn&rsquo;t even started high school before coming to a strange city to struggle, hoping to learn a skill to seek a place in a foreign land.</p>
<p>In that era when smartphones and short videos were not yet popular, perhaps because the nights were too long, they always needed to find a place to kill time after work. I was also brought into their life circle a few times. Sometimes we would go to an indoor roller skating rink and play for hours, sometimes we would chat in a corner of a bustling square, and sometimes we would just watch Ultraman all night in the room using an old DVD player. I was very young at that time, and naturally, my interactions and communications with them were not deep. Later, with various changes, we no longer kept in touch.</p>
<p>Thinking about it now, more than ten years later, they were only eighteen or nineteen at that time, but seemed to have a maturity beyond their age. At such a young age, they needed to find their place in this bustling city, yet had to face a life of rushing around, loneliness, and a sense of alienation from society. Perhaps only the free time at night could make them truly feel something that belonged to them. Later, I inquired a bit about their lives afterward. Some went back to their hometowns, doing some small businesses; some continued to struggle in Hangzhou, changing from one place to another, seemingly still unable to achieve the life they wanted. Just as described in the book, they wouldn&rsquo;t blame this era, but rather attribute the unsatisfactory parts of life to themselves, and that&rsquo;s all.</p>
<h2 id="personal-life-snapshot">Personal Life Snapshot</h2>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/boyi_universal.png" alt="boyi_universal"></p>
<p>My sister is on summer vacation, so she came to Beijing to play. Together with my senior, we went to Universal Studios. Although it was a weekend during the summer vacation, it wasn&rsquo;t as crowded as imagined.</p>
<p>We got to play all the popular projects. During the &ldquo;Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey&rdquo; project, my glasses flew off and haven&rsquo;t been found yet, so I went to the optical city to get a new pair. I guess coming to the magical world, you have to leave something behind.</p>
<p>Other than that, it&rsquo;s just the quiet flow of daily life, slow but beautiful. We met with Liangliang and other teachers who came to Beijing for an inspection, and talked about quite a lot of past events; we would occasionally explore some street corner restaurants, and also go to Yonghegong to listen to folk music on weekday nights, finding a moment of rest in the hustle and bustle; I would also pick up and drop off my senior from work during remote work breaks, chatting with the security guard at the door during the waiting intervals&hellip;</p>
<p>Perhaps it&rsquo;s because my mindset has changed, my living state and the way I view life have also changed a lot. It&rsquo;s hard to describe exactly, but generally, it&rsquo;s filled with more beauty and kindness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a long time since I showed Nini&rsquo;s daily life. Now her fur is getting thicker and heavier, maybe I&rsquo;ll take her for a bath and groom her fur next week.</p>

<h3 id="xlog">xLog</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/yu_xlog_profile.png" alt="yu_xlog_profile"></p>
<p>xLog is currently the main synchronization and backup platform for my own blog. Because I&rsquo;m reluctant to part with the previous data statistics and accumulated Cusdis comments, I still haven&rsquo;t been able to migrate the entire thing over. After the latest launch of the &ldquo;Portfolio&rdquo; feature, coupled with xSync, xFeed, and xChar, it has become a good personal Profile page for me, and I&rsquo;m becoming more and more dependent on it.</p>
<p>This is my portfolio page: <a href="https://xlog.pseudoyu.com/portfolios">xlog.pseudoyu.com/portfolios</a></p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/boyi_xlog.png" alt="boyi_xlog"></p>
<p>My senior&rsquo;s blog had been using the Hashnode platform, which is also a simple and easy-to-use platform. But with the evolution of xLog&rsquo;s features and the freedom given to creators, I still migrated it over. Apart from claiming CSB Token, the onboarding experience is already very good, and things like binding domains and umami parsing are also very convenient. I recommend friends who want to have their own blog to give it a try.</p>
<p>This is my senior&rsquo;s blog: <a href="https://www.boyilu.com">boyilu.com</a></p>
<p>During the migration and editing process, I read through everything again, and I still feel that text is the most comfortable and warmest way I can think of to understand and gradually get close to a person.</p>
<h3 id="personal-information-flow-synchronization-system">Personal Information Flow Synchronization System</h3>
<p>Due to Railway officially closing its Free Plan on August 1st, the n8n synchronization system was down for two days. After some research, I ended up running it on my own VPS using Docker (a BandwagonHOST ThePlan, 2c2g, coupled with NginxProxyManager for reverse proxy, running most of my services that require data persistence). I also updated the version while at it, and continued the synchronization.</p>
<p>As of writing this weekly review, the Telegram channel has 536 subscribers, and gradually I&rsquo;ve formed my own habit pattern of input and output. Although I&rsquo;ve been using Twitter (now maybe we should call it X) less and less, it&rsquo;s also reached 2000+ followers, which is a small milestone.</p>
<h3 id="open-source-budget">Open Source Budget</h3>
<p>In a previous weekly review &ldquo;<a href="https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2023/02/12/weekly_review_20230212/">Weekly Review #30 - Open Source Budget, Writing Intention, and Humility towards Technology</a>&rdquo;, I mentioned this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Randy&rsquo;s article &ldquo;<a href="https://lutaonan.com/blog/my-oss-donation-budget/">I Set Up a Monthly $20 Open Source Donation Budget for Myself</a>&rdquo;, I saw his concept and attitude towards open source projects, which I found very interesting and inspired me to set up a similar open source budget for myself. The current setting is at least $20 (about 130 RMB) or equivalent value budget per month, flexibly choosing according to my daily use and tech stack. I will choose the following projects for donation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Independent bloggers and developers who have inspired me</li>
<li>Projects that I often use when doing side projects and have solved very practical problems</li>
<li>Some interesting open source tools and services that I use frequently</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Previously, I had been regularly sponsoring <a href="https://github.com/reorx">reorx</a> on GitHub Sponsor. This month, after Randy released <a href="https://blog.cusdis.com/announcing-cusdis-pro/">Cusdis Pro</a> and <a href="https://notepal.randynamic.org/">Notepal</a>, I started sponsoring <a href="https://lutaonan.com/">Randy</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/sponsor_randy.png" alt="sponsor_randy"></p>

<h3 id="nuphy">Nuphy</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/nuphy_keyboard.png" alt="nuphy_keyboard"></p>
<p>I occasionally write some efficiency tool articles, and unexpectedly, I was contacted by Nuphy official to test the Nuphy Air60 keyboard. It&rsquo;s lightweight and has a high aesthetic value, I plan to carry it with me when I go out.</p>
<h3 id="others">Others</h3>
<p>I feel like many interesting things happened, but because they&rsquo;ve accumulated to a monthly scale, it&rsquo;s hard to recall them all at once. I&rsquo;ve started concentrating on learning Japanese, working on a tutorial set, and have many article topics I want to write about. I hope I can gradually fill these gaps in the future.</p>
<h3 id="input">Input</h3>
<p>Although most interesting inputs are automatically synchronized in the &ldquo;<a href="https://t.me/pseudoyulife">Yu&rsquo;s Life</a>&rdquo; Telegram channel, I&rsquo;ll still select some to list here. It feels more like a newsletter now.</p>
<h4 id="books">Books</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World</strong>, the description is very beautiful, and the protagonist&rsquo;s perspective has a kind of detachment from the world that I really like. The ending is calm yet unexpected. But unfortunately, I read this book over several months, mostly on planes or high-speed trains. Coupled with the setting of two parallel world lines, there&rsquo;s a strong sense of discontinuity in the plot. Perhaps I&rsquo;ll have a chance to read it carefully again.</li>
<li><strong>The Silent Workers</strong>, I have quite a few thoughts on this, which I wrote in the first part.</li>

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>This piece is a record and reflection of my life from June 22 to July 10, 2023.</p>
<p>The past few weeks have been both long and fleeting, filled with numerous events and thoughts I&rsquo;ve been eager to express. Yet, something in the depths of my heart has repeatedly held me back from putting pen to paper. It&rsquo;s as if everything isn&rsquo;t quite ready, and I find myself at a loss for words, wanting to tell a good story but unsure where to begin.</p>
<p>Tonight, in the depths of night, Spotify&rsquo;s Discover Weekly recommended HIGH4&amp;IU&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4ylBOzDEnU">Not Spring, Love, or Cherry Blossoms</a>&rdquo;. My emotions were gently touched, much like when I heard that line from Mayday&rsquo;s &ldquo;Tenderness&rdquo; - &ldquo;<em>Walking in the wind, today&rsquo;s sunlight suddenly feels so gentle</em>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The season may not be fitting, and the lyrics may not be particularly relevant, but there are always a few songs that can deeply connect with one&rsquo;s emotions at certain moments. Even just the prelude can make my heart dance in rhythm. So I hastily opened the blank blog document I had prepared long ago, wrote down this title, and wanted to quietly write in this place that has carried so many of my experiences and emotions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in love.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="in-the-mood-for-love">In the Mood for Love</h2>
<p>As I mentioned in my previous post, &ldquo;<a href="https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2023/06/21/weekly_review_20230621/">Weekly Review #42 - Views on Relationships, Life State, and Self</a>&rdquo;, I hardly feel fully prepared for a relationship. Many emotions may have eased but haven&rsquo;t yet settled, many aspects of my views on relationships, though recognized, still haven&rsquo;t been properly sorted out, and there are still many parts of myself that need to be understood and overcome.</p>
<p>However, sometimes life is like the intersection and convergence of world lines in &ldquo;Steins;Gate&rdquo; - complex yet traceable.</p>
<p>Mid-month, I went to Beijing to attend the Gopher China 2023 conference. As it was a stolen moment of leisure amidst busyness, I didn&rsquo;t arrange any special itinerary. I just thought that since I was back in Beijing, I&rsquo;d stay a few extra days and chose a hotel near boyi&rsquo;s home. After-work life became much more fulfilling - we would go to the Japanese restaurant at the entrance for dinner and chat, walk several kilometers to listen to a concert, and occasionally go to a quiet bar for a drink and to draw.</p>
<p>Perhaps because I had grown accustomed to and even longed for these few days of daily life, when the departure time was approaching and boyi said she suddenly had a work arrangement to go to Shanghai on a business trip, I almost without hesitation (even as if grasping at a lifeline) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll go with you.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m hardly one to believe in fatalism. After experiencing some things, it&rsquo;s hard to have faith in predestined fate. Perhaps without this choice, this sentence, the world line would have continued along its original trajectory. Perhaps it would converge again at some point in the future, perhaps not. Fortunately, it was so.</p>
<p>Although the trip to Shanghai was only two short days, changes were quietly taking place, and emotions were growing and spreading wildly in my heart. We walked and stopped on the Bund, guessing the words on the buildings across the river or on the cruise ships; we laughed in the sudden rain despite having umbrellas, like two people who never grew up.</p>
<p>When we parted ways at Hongqiao, we both understood that we could no longer maintain that tacit understanding we had before. However, I became afraid, retreated, and evaded.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Afraid of the emotions sprouting within me, fearing that my flawed self couldn&rsquo;t bear such a complex relationship, and also fearing that I might be insincere, indulging in momentary happiness.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is probably the most accurate description of my state at that time.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/beautiful_cloud_in_beijing_boyi.png" alt="beautiful_cloud_in_beijing_boyi"></p>
<p>The first week after returning, both sides cooled down, struggling and in pain. I talked with family and close friends until dawn, trying to shift my attention and no longer be moved by the existence far away, only to find it was in vain and self-deceptive. Every day seemed to be on the original life trajectory, but my heart was already in turmoil. I would be happy all night because boyi posted a beautiful cloud, and I would be sad all day because of a slightly polite tone.</p>
<p>So I secretly booked a ticket to Beijing, appeared at boyi&rsquo;s doorstep with flowers on the tail end of June, nervous, timid, yet expectant. Because I was too nervous to speak, I asked for whiskey to boost my courage (unknowingly drank almost half a bottle), and for fear that my half-drunk self hadn&rsquo;t properly confirmed my feelings, I sent that message &ldquo;boyi, I like you&rdquo; on WeChat right in front of her.</p>
<p>And then, I fell in love.</p>
<h2 id="except-for-spring-love-and-cherry-blossoms">Except for Spring, Love, and Cherry Blossoms</h2>
<p>Love has once again become something without much reality for me. Amidst the happiness, I seem to have just begun to slowly think, what is it between us?</p>
<p>The emotions of liking need not be said much, the novelty and curiosity, though beautiful, are often hard to last long, so what&rsquo;s left?</p>
<p>A montage video &ldquo;<a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Va4y1w7rh/">Nostalgic Montage | Do We, Drifting in the City, Gaze at the Same Sky?</a>&rdquo; reminded me of a line said by Rika in &ldquo;Tokyo Love Story&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;There must be many people like me in the world, lonely and solitary. But we all gaze at the same sky.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this is probably my current thought.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/weibo_about_boyi_when_we_meet_new.png" alt="weibo_about_boyi_when_we_meet_new"></p>
<p>I recall a Weibo post I made when we had just met but had to say goodbye to her leaving. Although I&rsquo;m not particularly good at expressing my emotions face-to-face with others, I clearly remember turning my head to hide my tears when touched by boyi&rsquo;s words on that rainy night, and these few sentences have stayed with me for many years. Perhaps at that moment, I felt a resonance - similarly drifting about, similarly pretending to be strong and indifferent, yet touched and at a loss by things so small they couldn&rsquo;t be smaller.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/tokyo_love_story_stars.png" alt="tokyo_love_story_stars"></p>
<p>Everyone is an independent individual. I can hardly become, nor do I wish to make another person my star/spiritual support. <strong>But perhaps, we can gaze at the same sky together, quietly holding each other&rsquo;s hands when our eyes are dazzled by the bustling crowds and spreading street lights.</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/yu_running_records.png" alt="yu_running_records"></p>
<p>The biggest change in my life these weeks is that I&rsquo;ve started running every day. I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://twitter.com/yihong0618">yihong0618</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="https://github.com/yihong0618/running_page">GitHub - running_page</a>&rdquo; and continuing to form the habit. I&rsquo;ve also been getting up around 7 every day, and I really feel like the world is different.</p>
<p>There are quite a few other things I want to talk about, but I&rsquo;ll leave that for later.</p>

<li><strong>Black Mirror Season 6</strong>, disappointing. I had quite a few expectations before watching, the first episode felt a bit flat but still creative, didn&rsquo;t expect it to be the peak. It feels strangely commercial. In comparison, many plots from the first and second seasons still don&rsquo;t feel outdated or even forward-looking even after many years.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>A Man</strong>, I actually wanted to write a review for this movie, but it seems I haven&rsquo;t watched it deeply enough. I&rsquo;ll rewatch it.</li>
<li><strong>Lost in the Stars</strong>, it feels like the first movie I&rsquo;ve watched in a theater in nearly a year. It&rsquo;s a bit hard to describe, the logic and rhythm feel a bit disconnected.</li>

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>This is a record and reflection of my life from <code>2023-06-13</code> to <code>2023-06-21</code>.</p>
<p>This week, I traveled to many places and experienced some emotional fluctuations. After returning, I was busy with various trivial matters, which is why I&rsquo;m only now sitting down to write this weekly review.</p>
<p>I went back to Beijing to visit my former company and met with my previous leaders. We discussed many topics including web3, AI, and various technical issues. I had dinner with old colleagues, drinking and chatting about different life trajectories and mindsets. I attended a Drink &amp; Draw event, which was novel and pleasant. I went on another trip to Shanghai with Boyi, who happened to be on a business trip - a familiar yet precious experience. On Saturday, I participated in HZLUG and met many developers I&rsquo;ve long admired on Twitter. There were many other interesting events.</p>
<p>Also, I&rsquo;ve changed the song to &ldquo;Tenderness&rdquo; by Mayday.</p>
<h2 id="views-on-love">Views on Love</h2>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/wine_drink_and_draw.jpg" alt="wine_drink_and_draw"></p>
<p>In fact, I often mentioned love in earlier weekly reviews. It was like a place for emotional catharsis. As my life focus gradually shifted, I went to the other extreme and stopped mentioning it altogether.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until my birthday reflection, when I had to recall the darkest moment of the past year that I couldn&rsquo;t bypass, that I picked up some memories again. A few days ago, when talking with Ni, I began to realize that what I couldn&rsquo;t let go of was just the memory and the incomprehension and so-called hurt caused by what I thought was an abrupt ending, rather than a specific person or even a concrete relationship.</p>
<p>I knew that whether to move on or to reorganize my life, I needed to face these experiences and internalize them into my own views on love. But I chose to shelve it, even immersing myself in a state of self-deception, unwilling to face and think about it. I just told myself, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only been a year, no rush.&rdquo; Perhaps people ultimately love themselves more, preferring to instinctively protect themselves.</p>
<p>An unexpected conversation made me realize this self-deception, and I found that I was gradually losing the courage to face love. My thoughts on love were so tangled that I could hardly distinguish them. I was afraid of the emotions sprouting within me, fearing that my flawed self couldn&rsquo;t bear such a complex relationship, and also fearing that I might be insincere in my momentary happiness.</p>
<p>Perhaps what one needs to overcome at any stage is always the self. I probably really need some time to reorganize my views on love, to rediscover myself, and to start anew.</p>
<h2 id="life-state">Life State</h2>
<p>My life state is similar. I originally thought that with the extra time from remote work, I could use it to adjust my daily routine, focus on health, or do more things I wanted to do. But many times, I still put my mind and time into work and some learning. It&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;m trying to outdo others, but it seems that I often have an indifferent attitude towards other aspects of my life, having a kind of detached observation of my own life.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/morning_scene_run.jpg" alt="morning_scene_run"></p>
<p>As I want to get my life and everything around me back on track, I&rsquo;ve started to follow a joke about &ldquo;walking myself every day&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ve begun to pay attention to sleep again, get up early for a run, and reorganize my reading list, reading a few pages after coming back from a run.</p>
<p>The next morning, walking to the ancient town district by the river, seeing the delicate sunlight sprinkling through the gaps in the branches onto the ground, I found an irrepressible desire to share after taking a photo. It seems I&rsquo;m gradually regaining some long-unfamiliar expectations for life itself. Where the heart leads, the feet follow.</p>
<h2 id="personal-life-snapshots">Personal Life Snapshots</h2>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/pic_drink_and_draw.jpg" alt="pic_drink_and_draw"></p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/pic_boyi_drink_and_draw.jpg" alt="pic_boyi_drink_and_draw"></p>
<p>I experienced a Drink &amp; Draw event for the first time. Although I only did the &ldquo;Drink&rdquo; part at the scene, it was an interesting experience. On stage, models were creating various scenes, while below, many art enthusiasts were immersed in their work. Some captured the essence with just a few strokes, while others meticulously traced their own interpretations. I observed from the side, seeming to find some tranquility.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been to Shanghai many times, so I didn&rsquo;t take many photos. But this time was a rare opportunity to explore leisurely without a tight schedule.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/rust_china_conf_2023.jpg" alt="rust_china_conf_2023"></p>
<p>Invited by a friend, I hurried to Shanghai early Sunday morning to attend Rust China Conf 2023. As a Gopher infiltrating the event, I didn&rsquo;t understand most of it, but the peripherals were really nice. I feel like the clothes, bags, and totes I&rsquo;ve received from events over these few months are enough for me to wear until next year.</p>
<p>I was also very happy to meet Teacher &ldquo;Tiny Bear&rdquo; from the Upchain community, introduced by a friend. When I first started learning about blockchain and smart contracts, I watched many tutorials on Upchain. I never thought I&rsquo;d meet him and even help prepare a set of video tutorials on the Solidity Foundry framework. It feels a bit unreal, like breaking through a dimensional wall.</p>

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>This is a record and reflection of my life from May 30, 2023 to June 12, 2023.</p>
<p>On the first day of June, I told a friend, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m usually quite miserable every May, June will definitely be my lucky month.&rdquo; Whether it was a psychological effect or the power of will, these two weeks after entering June have seen improvements in various aspects. I managed to refactor some business code during work tasks, reducing many potential issues. STRRL and I attended Rokid&rsquo;s offline experience event, where I even met my idol developer, Tulading. Although I no longer care much about birthday rituals, a group of friends still remembered and prepared some small surprises. It seems that after my birthday, I started to gradually step out of my small world. I met with old high school friends whom I hadn&rsquo;t seen for seven or eight years, rekindling some emotions. Over the weekend, I made a flash trip to Beijing to attend Gopher China 2023, ate and played with senior Boyi, had dinner and chatted with Homura, and went to Noy&rsquo;s house to pet cats. There were many other interesting things too.</p>
<h2 id="the-ritual-of-birthdays">The Ritual of Birthdays</h2>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/comments_about_birthday.png" alt="comments_about_birthday"></p>
<p>A few days ago, I received a comment from a reader friend, talking about the perception of birthdays and how attitudes towards things change after starting work. I can actually relate to this quite well. I used to care a lot about birthdays. I&rsquo;m not sure if it was about the day itself or if I wanted to confirm my importance to those around me through this way. Every year as the time approached, I would start to look forward to it and often called up a large group of people to gather and celebrate.</p>
<p>As I gradually left my familiar life circle and rarely met with close friends, I no longer had this obsession. Fortunately, there are still some friends who remember and send blessings, giving me a sense of what a birthday feels like.</p>
<p>This year, perhaps because I made a promise to sort out my emotions and feelings on my birthday every year, I started browsing through my previous weekly reviews early and thinking about my thoughts and feelings over the past year. Only then did I realize that besides the increase in numbers, so many changes had occurred. Of course, some of these changes were positive, while others were not so satisfactory. But having this review naturally brings some expectations. I think the meaning and ritual of this year&rsquo;s birthday stems from this.</p>
<p>Self-reflection through writing has given me so much. As I replied to this friend&rsquo;s comment: &ldquo;At least for myself, my way out of the quagmire is through words. The weekly review is, to some extent, my self-redemption.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Additionally, I was surprised and grateful for the comments and blessings from many unfamiliar friends on the article &ldquo;A 26-Year-Old&rsquo;s Confession: The Stone Pusher&rdquo;. It was very heartwarming. You all accompanied me through a meaningful day, and I hope we can continue to walk together.</p>
<h3 id="input-output-and-time-management">Input, Output, and Time Management</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/time_management_comments.png" alt="time_management_comments"></p>
<p>I received a comment on a somewhat distant weekly review about efficiency and time management. To be honest, answering this question now is a bit embarrassing. Last year, I was quite satisfied with the quality and quantity of my input and output, but there wasn&rsquo;t really any scientific method. Initially, I was just focused on investing all my time in self-improvement to escape from some things, so even when I was busy, I still managed to find a lot of time to do what I liked.</p>
<p>As I gradually immersed myself in some technical learning and interest exploration, I also started to have some output and positive feedback. If I skipped the weekly review for a week or two, I would receive quite a few reminders to update, which naturally gave me more motivation to keep going. I&rsquo;ve always enjoyed the &ldquo;Learn/Build in public&rdquo; approach. Apart from blogs and tweets, my Telegram channel &ldquo;Yu&rsquo;s Life&rdquo; used for synchronization mostly syncs my likes, favorites, and forwards. In fact, just like how I never set my Moments to be visible only to certain groups, I don&rsquo;t distinguish between public/private accounts or lists at all, which means all my behaviors are completely transparent.</p>
<p>When I finish a day&rsquo;s work or have some free time, if I feel like I haven&rsquo;t had much extra input that day, I&rsquo;ll have a kind of motivation to read a few articles/tutorials saved in my &ldquo;read later&rdquo; list, open Kindle to read a half-finished book, or find a movie from my Douban list that I&rsquo;ve been wanting to watch. Unknowingly, this has become a habit. I often browse through my channel as a way of organizing information, and when I see that my output has been sporadic, I feel a bit guilty.</p>
<p>So when there are no updates on my channel for several consecutive days, <del>it&rsquo;s probably because I&rsquo;m slacking off</del>.</p>
<p>As for time management, I can&rsquo;t say I have any good practices. I mainly use Logseq for basic task recording and Cron for schedule management (I only started using it frequently recently, and the menu bar schedule reminders are quite useful). I haven&rsquo;t deliberately used tools like the Pomodoro technique for strict management for a long time. I&rsquo;m more used to arranging things according to my immersion state rather than according to fixed time blocks.</p>
<p>In terms of energy management, the only thing I can say is that I maintain a relatively low level of demand for eating, drinking, playing, and sleeping. Often, I&rsquo;ll just have one casual meal or some fruit in a day, and I don&rsquo;t really have any hobbies that kill time, so I have a bit more time. Of course, this doesn&rsquo;t mean all this time is spent meaningfully. There are often times when it&rsquo;s wasted, but I don&rsquo;t have any strict standards for myself, so I can maintain a relatively balanced state.</p>
<p><del>Don&rsquo;t learn from sleeping at five and waking up at eight</del>. In the &ldquo;Vanishing Sleep&rdquo; part of my previous weekly review, I just reflected on this myself.</p>
<h2 id="personal-life-snapshots">Personal Life Snapshots</h2>
<p>After going out to participate in the Open Source Summer event, I started to become interested in participating in these technology/science/digital events and became more willing to go out and meet some friends.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/nienie_space_at_home.jpg" alt="nienie_space_at_home"></p>
<p>I invited two friends who came to Hangzhou from Beijing to come to my home to play with Nini. I enthusiastically introduced them to some smart pet home products from Petkit. They were completely defenseless against these electronic toys, but I didn&rsquo;t have anything new to tinker with myself, so Nini became the &ldquo;victim&rdquo;. Basically, we can track her every move in the app, even measuring her food intake down to the gram.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/nienie_big_eye.jpg" alt="nienie_big_eye"></p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/nienie_in_remote_camera_ebo.png" alt="nienie_in_remote_camera_ebo"></p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/nienie_in_bag.png" alt="nienie_in_bag"></p>
<p>Nini was also called a toy cat/ornament by friends. She would just stay still wherever we put her in a corner, content to be petted or waiting for us to pose her for photos. She&rsquo;s too well-behaved.</p>
<p>This time when I went back to Beijing, I happily went to Noy&rsquo;s house to pet cats. Their cat is called &ldquo;Tietie&rdquo;, a very small and cute Russian Blue. She&rsquo;s also very well-behaved and kept playing with the data cable I brought.</p>

<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/tietie_lay.jpg" alt="tietie_lay"></p>
<p>A week of happily cuddling cats!!!</p>
<p>The main reason for this trip to Beijing was to attend the Gopher China 2023 conference. I&rsquo;ve been in GoCN for two years now, and it was the first time meeting some team members and Asta Xie in person. During the event, I had a great chat about Serverless and GPT with a guy at an outdoor tent booth. Just as we were about to add each other on WeChat, we realized he was my Twitter friend &ldquo;Carson Yang (MichelangeloYang)&rdquo;. We had even had some small exchanges on Telegram before. Indeed, Twitter friends are all big shots.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/lunch_with_homura.jpg" alt="lunch_with_homura"></p>
<p>Although time was a bit rushed, I had a delicious buffet lunch with Homura at noon. We had a great chat!</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/candle_music.jpg" alt="candle_music"></p>
<p>The rest of the time was mostly spent with senior Boyi showing me around. Because it was quite casual, I didn&rsquo;t take many photos. I did record a candlelight concert that left a deep impression on me. It had a great atmosphere.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/aniya_toy_from_boyi.jpg" alt="aniya_toy_from_boyi"></p>
<p>And amazingly, senior Boyi has a superpower. She can always get what she wants from gashapon machines. I didn&rsquo;t believe it before, but she got the Anya I wanted on the first try (and then I kept happily clutching Anya&rsquo;s capsule toy, I think even the shop owner was amused).</p>

<h2 id="confession-at-26-the-stone-pusher">Confession at 26: The Stone-Pusher</h2>
<p>It is now June 6, 2023, and I am 26 years old. As I grow older, I no longer feel much ceremony or anticipation for my birthday itself. Yet, it still serves as a milestone, reminding me that another year has passed. Since last year, I decided to leave some words on my birthday and New Year&rsquo;s Eve, as a way to account for the time that has elapsed.</p>
<p>In fact, over the past year, I have written 40 weekly reports. I thought I had grown accustomed to sharing my emotions, but as I put pen to paper, I still feel a sense of bewilderment, unsure where to begin.</p>
<p>The events of the latter half of 2022 were detailed in my year-end review, &ldquo;<a href="https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2022/12/31/yearly_review_2022/">2022 Year-End Review - Confusion, Low Points, and Change</a>&rdquo;. The changes I&rsquo;ve experienced this year have been mentioned to varying degrees in my intermittent weekly reports. Not wishing to be redundant, or perhaps hesitant to reminisce, on this birthday, I only want to discuss life itself.</p>
<p>Just as I try to assign a few keywords to each weekly review, I always attempt to give a theme to the path I&rsquo;ve traversed in the past. After much contemplation, I decided to name it &ldquo;The Stone-Pusher&rdquo;, derived from the story of Sisyphus - a tale of ceaseless effort, absurdity, and repetition, where one continuously pushes a boulder to the mountaintop, only to watch it roll down again, and then push it back up once more.</p>
<p>Last year, I experienced a breakup just before my birthday. On the day itself, I only remembered it was my birthday after receiving well-wishes. I struggled to get up and respond to my friends&rsquo; greetings, recalling whether it had been one or two months since I last stepped out of my room. I chewed a few melatonin tablets and returned to another sleepless night. Perhaps out of pity, a friend sent me a bouquet of flowers and a cake during the day. Due to lack of appetite, I ritualistically tasted a bite just minutes before my birthday ended. It was sweet but impossible to swallow.</p>
<p>Throughout the past year, people often asked at various stages, &ldquo;Have you moved on?&rdquo; The question wasn&rsquo;t difficult, but I never really knew how to answer.</p>
<p>I suppose it was around July when I returned to Hangzhou to clear my mind, changed my hair color, and met friends, that I decided to continue living? I filled my idle time with various courses and learning new technologies, pouring my pent-up desire to share into blog posts and Twitter updates. At the time, I seemed to believe that if I compressed my time to leave no room for reminiscence, I could gradually move on. Months passed, and when I thought I had come to terms with everything, when I felt I could slowly progress on a new life trajectory, suddenly, a small memory of our past interaction - so small that I can&rsquo;t even accurately describe it now - brought everything back to square one.</p>
<p>It was then that I realized I had been doing something akin to Sisyphus all along, pushing the boulder with all my might, only to watch everything crumble. Many things in the past year have been like this.</p>
<p>In my rented apartment in Hangzhou, there&rsquo;s a potted plant. I don&rsquo;t know much about it, but it should be an easy-to-care-for variety. It came with the apartment and sits in a conspicuous spot. Working remotely, I see it every day, yet I never really paid attention to it. It wasn&rsquo;t until a few days ago when a friend visited from Beijing to play with my cat that I thought to tidy up a bit. I noticed many leaves had withered, and the soil had dried out completely. As I was about to water it, I accidentally knocked it over, scattering soil everywhere. This reminded me of a random thought I had written before.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/random_thoughts_20220530.png" alt="random_thoughts_20220530"></p>
<p>Suddenly, my emotions hit rock bottom. Irritation, depression, beyond consolation. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lost too much this year. Any small death or breakdown becomes unbearable.&rdquo; When I saw this sentence in Brother Lu&rsquo;s video at the beginning of the year, I couldn&rsquo;t help but choke up. Perhaps this is the most apt description. I realized I hadn&rsquo;t made much progress in &ldquo;accepting loss&rdquo; at all.</p>
<p>Yet, life must go on. If there&rsquo;s one thing I&rsquo;ve truly learned this year, it&rsquo;s probably just &ldquo;to face life itself honestly.&rdquo;</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/nienie_painting.jpg" alt="nienie_painting"></p>
<p>I adopted a lovely cat named Nini.</p>
<p>Raising a cat alone has always been something that required courage for me. After all, I felt that my own standards for quality of life might not even match a cat&rsquo;s. But I still chose to take responsibility for a new life companion. Although I worried to the point of losing my appetite when she fell ill, and my hand trembled when signing the consent form for her spaying surgery, experiencing some troublesome moments, she has accompanied me, often soothing my emotions, and teaching me how to love.</p>
<p>Nini gave me the courage to continue living.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/yu_new_desk_setup.jpg" alt="yu_new_desk_setup"></p>
<p>During my work in Beijing for most of last year, I had friends who treated me well, some familiar colleagues, and like-minded leaders who gave me considerable freedom. However, I didn&rsquo;t grow in various aspects as expected, and I became increasingly confused about my direction. I was constantly busy to the point of neglecting my life. As these emotions accumulated, I decided to leave.</p>
<p>Life and work after returning to Hangzhou have been calm, simple, yet not without joy. I live with Nini in my rented apartment, each of us immersed in our own world. The remote work mode has given me more free time to participate in many interesting activities, like going to Hong Kong for Mayday&rsquo;s concert, or drinking and chatting with long-unseen roommates in Xi&rsquo;an. The good technical atmosphere allows me to constantly explore new tech stacks, and I would occasionally stay up all night tackling a requirement or technical problem, just like old times.</p>
<p>However, perhaps because it&rsquo;s been exactly a year since that darkest period last year, I&rsquo;ve gradually found myself falling back into the same repetitive state over the past two months. Sleep deprivation has become the norm, with 4 or 5 am wake-ups being common. Social isolation, often not leaving the house for one or two weeks. Inexplicable anxiety, eager to change but not knowing how to start, frequently frustrated.</p>
<p>The past year has indeed been difficult. I still often find myself fragile and sensitive, still dwelling on the emotions of a ended relationship. I still haven&rsquo;t learned how to pick up life again. Many of the goals I set at the beginning of the year haven&rsquo;t made much progress. Despite having more time, I&rsquo;ve read fewer books and watched fewer movies. I still stay up late every day until I&rsquo;m physically and mentally exhausted, yet unable to change. I still haven&rsquo;t become the ideal version of myself, still haven&rsquo;t found the meaning of life.</p>
<p>But this is life itself. It faces everyone fairly and cruelly.</p>
<p>I have gradually stopped complaining and instead embrace it sincerely and passionately.</p>
<p>The boulder will always roll down, but when we open our eyes early tomorrow morning, we still have to push it up again.</p>

<p>Happy 26th birthday to myself.</p>

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>This piece is a record and reflection of my life from <code>2023-05-21</code> to <code>2023-05-29</code>.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until the weekend that I realized I hadn&rsquo;t gone downstairs at all this week, which seems to have become the norm in my life. However, my efficiency was decent. At work, I researched and learned about some new things, and continued to read documents related to chains and contracts. Out of interest, I also briefly looked at Swift and SwiftUI tutorials. As a deep user of the Apple ecosystem, I&rsquo;ve always been interested in these underlying technologies, although I rarely use them at work. It was a good opportunity to learn about them. On the weekend, thinking I couldn&rsquo;t be so introverted anymore, I attended the &ldquo;Open Source Summer&rdquo; offline event that I had previously signed up for. It was quite fun. There were many other interesting things as well.</p>
<h2 id="beyond-code">Beyond Code</h2>
<h3 id="open-source-summer">Open Source Summer</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/open_source_activities.jpg" alt="open_source_activities"></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not actually someone who&rsquo;s particularly keen on attending offline events. I often just stay in my own world. After returning to Hangzhou in March and April, I wanted to take a step out, so I frequently attended the Web3 Festival in Hong Kong and various surrounding offline events. But I actually found that I&rsquo;m not so enthusiastic about meeting many new people or maintaining continuous enthusiasm for an energy-consuming activity, so I haven&rsquo;t paid much attention to or participated in such events since coming back.</p>
<p>This time, I saw STRRL post about it on Twitter, and I also learned that Zhizi and Bread were going to give speeches. I found it quite interesting, and it wasn&rsquo;t far, so I went. I arrived quite early and got a lot of fun peripherals. I feel like I won&rsquo;t be short of stickers when I change my computer next time.</p>
<p>Later, I heard many open source experts share their experiences, and had some small exchanges with some of them. I felt that curiosity and love for tinkering are quite common traits. When encountering something interesting or some real-world problems, we always trace back to the source. Even if we find it&rsquo;s not our problem, we don&rsquo;t stop there, but continue to explore upstream, whether it&rsquo;s an Issue or a PR.</p>
<p>Recently, I&rsquo;ve actually been caught in a kind of self-consuming anxiety. My work is actually much more interesting than before, and I have some of my own time to learn things I&rsquo;m interested in. But perhaps because there are too many things I want to do, and my self-discipline and execution often can&rsquo;t be as stable as expected, I&rsquo;ve been feeling a bit stuck. However, after participating in this event, I&rsquo;ve improved quite a bit. I feel that whether it&rsquo;s open source or this field, there are still many interesting things to do, and no matter what stage you&rsquo;re at, you can still do interesting things. I guess this is also the original intention why I&rsquo;ve always wanted to work in technology.</p>
<p>My mentality is quite strange. My anxiety doesn&rsquo;t seem to come from the so-called Peer Pressure. In this field, not to mention peers, there are too many experts who might be much younger than me. On the contrary, participating in such events and seeing these possibilities and the people I want to become, alleviates my negative emotions quite a bit.</p>
<h3 id="desire-to-share">Desire to Share</h3>
<p>This week, I listened to Geekplux and Randy&rsquo;s podcast channel &ldquo;<a href="https://bento.me/beyondcode">Beyond Code</a>&rdquo;. They are both seniors that I really like and have had some contact with. Listening to them chat is a very enjoyable thing. They&rsquo;re not talking about any specific technical details or teaching, but you can feel that even though the show is called &ldquo;Beyond Code&rdquo;, their lives have already become inseparable from the technology and code they love.</p>
<p>What left a deep impression on me was also Randy talking about the issue of the desire to share. He said that when he first started playing with Twitter, he always wanted to share some of his thoughts and feelings, but now he always worries about whether it would be &ldquo;too much&rdquo;. I think although the situations are not the same, I also share less than before because I&rsquo;m worried that my input, output, or ideas are a bit messy. I seem to be a bit timid about sharing information that hasn&rsquo;t been sorted out and organized.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/tg_channel_survey.png" alt="tg_channel_survey"></p>
<p>Reorx also initiated such a survey in his channel before. Because my channel was initially a fork version of his channel, I also had similar confusion around the same time period. But later I thought about it and decided not to give myself too much mental burden. I just added an extra layer of self-questioning before sharing, requiring it to be content that I&rsquo;ve read carefully and gained something from, rather than just seeing recommended or some &ldquo;seemingly&rdquo; useful resource integration. As for the rest, I&rsquo;ll just focus on improving the value and purity of my input and output.</p>
<p>I also heard them talk about many topics, including work, growth, different living environments, plans after leaving a job, AI, etc. I also heard that Randy might produce some tutorials and courses. I benefited a lot from his small book &ldquo;<a href="https://nextjs-in-action-cn.taonan.lu/">Next.js Application Development Practice</a>&rdquo; before. Some later projects were completely carried out according to this practice. The way of presentation and depth are very suitable for people who want to do some small projects independently. Looking forward to it.</p>
<h2 id="vanishing-sleep">Vanishing Sleep</h2>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s because working remotely at home blurs the sense of time, but my schedule has been getting more and more outrageous recently. Sometimes even though I&rsquo;ve finished work, I still don&rsquo;t go to sleep until three or four in the morning. I wake up once around 9 am, but occasionally I just turn off the alarm and sleep through it. I start handling work and various things around 11 am, until midnight, and the cycle repeats.</p>
<p>Actually, I feel like my body&rsquo;s load is still okay, but I increasingly feel that sleep does easily affect my mental state. I always feel like if I sleep too late, the next day lacks a sense of reality. Because I just recovered from COVID-19, I haven&rsquo;t started morning runs yet, but I bought a yoga mat planning to do some basic indoor exercise and fitness, and I&rsquo;ve also picked up Ring Fit Adventure, which I had only progressed halfway through.</p>
<p>Now, possibly because I&rsquo;m always in a state of fatigue when it&rsquo;s time to sleep, I rarely have any dreams. But on the few days when I do, I seem to always recall some things from the past. The thoughts are distant yet real. I often used to say that May always seems to be quite bad every year. Now there&rsquo;s only one day left in May. I hope June, a month I really like, will bring some improvements.</p>
<h2 id="nie-nie">Nie Nie</h2>
<p>Nie Nie has finally regained her spirit. Now she runs around everywhere. When I&rsquo;m working or doing overtime, she lies on my legs or on the floor beside me. She&rsquo;s so well-behaved.</p>

<h2 id="interesting-things-and-objects">Interesting Things and Objects</h2>
<h3 id="mastodon">Mastodon</h3>
<p>This week, due to some work-related matters, I started to look at some Mastodon materials in detail again. Compared to the last time I learned about it, I saw two new articles and several projects:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://checkfirst.network/mastodon-the-rise-of-fediverse/">Mastodon, the rise of the Fediverse</a></li>
<li><a href="https://tidbits.com/2023/01/27/mastodon-a-new-hope-for-social-networking/">Mastodon: A New Hope for Social Networking</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Mainly because public servers generally set some rate limits and so on, I was thinking about building one myself. But since I actually only need to use support for the Mastodon API, and don&rsquo;t really need to handle so many connections or complex interactive interfaces, I learned about the following projects, which I might set up and play with:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/wildebeest">GitHub - cloudflare/wildebeest: Wildebeest is an ActivityPub and Mastodon-compatible server</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/davecheney/pub">GitHub - davecheney/pub: pub, a tiny ActivityPub to Mastodon bridge</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/superseriousbusiness/gotosocial">GitHub - superseriousbusiness/gotosocial: Fast, fun, ActivityPub server, powered by Go.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mattn/go-mastodon">GitHub - mattn/go-mastodon: mastodon client for golang</a></li>
</ul>
<p>go-mastodon is an SDK for calling through go. Wildebeest is mostly based on Cloudflare&rsquo;s free services, and after setting it up, it won&rsquo;t require much additional operation and maintenance management, which is quite worry-free. pub is a lightweight bridge application that supports minimal API access but doesn&rsquo;t need to implement complex functions. gotosocial is a more feature-complete application that consumes moderate resources.</p>
<p>It feels like the Fediverse comes in waves, with very few people actually speaking on it. I guess I&rsquo;ll just treat it as my own little paradise.</p>

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>This piece records and reflects on my life from May 1, 2023 to May 20, 2023.</p>
<p>As I type this first line, I realize it has been delayed for three weeks. Many interesting things happened during this period, but it seems my desire to share has been gradually fading. I only jotted down some fragmented thoughts in Logseq, and despite several attempts to organize them, I couldn&rsquo;t find the right approach. So I didn&rsquo;t force it. The stagnation lasted until last week when I was slowly recovering, but then I became busy with an upcoming project launch. It was postponed to this weekend, and before I knew it, here we are.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, after surviving three years of the pandemic as one of the rare uninfected people around me, I caught it in this wave. My fever reached 39.5°C over the weekend, and I initially thought it was just a minor cold. It wasn&rsquo;t until Monday, when I was almost recovered, that I thought to take an antigen test. Sure enough, it showed two lines. Overall, it was a mild case - I had a fever for a day, a sore throat that felt like swallowing knives for another day, and then gradually recovered. I suppose you could say I speed-ran COVID.</p>
<p>So this weekend marks a moment when everything seems to be improving. Most of the project requirements have been completed, giving me a brief respite. My COVID recovery serves as a wake-up call for my health. Pinch, post-neutering, has had its stitches removed and regained its lively nature. I&rsquo;ve also started to resume my normal input and output frequency.</p>
<p>During the May Day holiday, I went to Chengdu to attend an event and met some friends. After a hurried trip, I went to Xi&rsquo;an for a leisure tour and met a long-lost college roommate, finally fulfilling a years-old promise, though we were nearly stranded at the airport due to the return-to-work rush. There were many other interesting events as well.</p>
<h2 id="old-friends-and-past-emotions">Old Friends and Past Emotions</h2>
<p>I have a roommate who, despite only being classmates for our freshman year (he later transferred majors), has stayed in touch with me to this day. As the number of people I can call friends dwindles, this connection becomes particularly precious. During college, we made a promise to meet in his hometown of Xining. Years have passed, I&rsquo;ve moved through several cities, and he has settled in Xi&rsquo;an for work. After years apart, I took the opportunity of the May Day holiday to visit Xi&rsquo;an. It wasn&rsquo;t really a tourist trip, just drinking and chatting, just like old times.</p>
<p>In my memory, he was unrestrained and cynical. Due to our frequent chats or phone calls, our long-awaited reunion still felt familiar. Beyond the mundane routine of work, he still persists in running, playing guitar, and reading. He still disdains and dissatisfies with worldly matters, yet lives along his own trajectory, with a newfound gentleness.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/meet_with_ledi.jpg" alt="meet_with_ledi"></p>
<p>As it was my first visit to Xi&rsquo;an, despite it being the May Day holiday, I still braved the crowds to briefly visit tourist attractions like the Big Wild Goose Pagoda. Back when I was still passionate about photography, I would always carry my camera and take many shots wherever I went. After the trip, I would edit and share the photos. But after several years of the pandemic, this enthusiasm has gradually faded. On trips in the past two years, even if I brought my camera on a whim, I often couldn&rsquo;t capture much. It seems that neither natural nor cultural landscapes can truly captivate me anymore. What remains are more often the casual group photos taken on the spur of the moment.</p>
<h2 id="rediscovered-desire-to-share">Rediscovered Desire to Share</h2>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/memories_in_t5.png" alt="memories_in_t5"></p>
<p>My hard drive also contains numerous unorganized photo and video materials. Most of them have been rendered untimely by the passage of time, relegated to being fragments of memory scattered in some folder. I remember before my birthday in 2021, due to many events that had occurred, I shot some videos, intending to share and record those experiences as a video birthday summary. In the end, I never got around to organizing those materials, and later, I didn&rsquo;t even leave much in writing.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until 2022 that I started recording again. In the blink of an eye, a year has passed. Perhaps because it&rsquo;s a similar time of year, I&rsquo;ve been having trouble sleeping lately, inevitably revisiting some traces of the past, or suddenly feeling wistful when a friend remarks, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a whole year already.&rdquo; Recently, when I want to put pen to paper, I often worry about continuing to write about those somewhat depressing emotions. Although genuine, they feel powerless and leave me feeling exhausted.</p>
<p>Upon careful reflection, I&rsquo;ve made some changes this year, bringing me closer, more or less, to the person I want to become. As I wished, I&rsquo;ve gained some freedom, both in work and daily life, bringing me closer to life itself. Although I still procrastinate at times, I&rsquo;ve recorded many of my thoughts and insights, thinking more about self-reflection. I&rsquo;ve learned some things I wanted to learn and explored and practiced more of my own ideas. I&rsquo;ve also experienced some interesting things in the company of friends, not confining myself to my own world as I did last year.</p>
<p>Everything seems to be slowly improving, and for things that can&rsquo;t be changed, I&rsquo;ve resolved to move forward. This is how I console myself.</p>
<p>Fortunately, recent progress in both work and life has been quite good, with some positive signals. I&rsquo;ve also gradually noticed the return of my desire to share and create. After a brief review, I realized there are many things I want to do and need to do. Many were set aside for various reasons, and now I&rsquo;m starting to pick them up one by one.</p>
<h2 id="interesting-things-and-objects">Interesting Things and Objects</h2>
<h3 id="github-copilot-chat">GitHub Copilot Chat</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/github_copilot_chat_use.png" alt="github_copilot_chat_use"></p>
<p>Recently, I&rsquo;ve become highly dependent on AI-assisted programming, mostly using ChatGPT and the GitHub Copilot plugin. I&rsquo;ve just been approved for the Copilot Chat internal beta, so I plan to switch and try it out.</p>
<p>It seems there might be some issues with the ChatGPT Plus billing. After it expires, I&rsquo;ll need to find another solution. I might try renewing it using US gift cards, which is quite a hassle.</p>
<h3 id="vs-code">VS Code</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/eva_vscode_theme.png" alt="eva_vscode_theme"></p>
<p>Also, because I&rsquo;ve been using VS Code (still holding out despite being looked down upon by the Jetbrains faction in the team), I discovered this <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RuDevIO.evangelion-theme">EVA theme</a> through a tweet by <a href="https://twitter.com/DIYgod">DIYGod</a>. It gives a strange coding power boost, making it feel like there are fewer bugs. Indeed, aesthetics are the primary productivity factor.</p>
<p>For program launchers, I&rsquo;ve been mixing the use of Alfred and Raycast. I use Alfred because I&rsquo;m used to it and bought the Mega Supporter License, but I&rsquo;m also envious of Raycast&rsquo;s plugin ecosystem.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/raycast_vscode.png" alt="raycast_vscode"></p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/raycast_vscode_recent_project.png" alt="raycast_vscode_recent_project"></p>
<p>Recently, I discovered that Raycast can configure many plugin functions to be called through global shortcuts. As I often need to open different VS Code projects, I configured the &ldquo;Open with VS Code&rdquo; and &ldquo;Recent Projects&rdquo; functions to <code>Option</code> + <code>.</code> and <code>Option</code> + <code>,</code> respectively, and I&rsquo;ve become highly dependent on them.</p>
<h3 id="input">Input</h3>
<p>Although most interesting inputs are automatically synchronized in the &ldquo;Yu&rsquo;s Life&rdquo; Telegram channel, I&rsquo;ll still select a few to list here. It feels more like a newsletter now.</p>

<li><strong>Uncle from Another World</strong>, I forgot which month&rsquo;s anime it was, it felt like it had been on hiatus for a long time.

I mostly watched it while doing other things.</li>
<li><strong>Chainsaw Man</strong>, marking it as watched. It&rsquo;s a classic revisit, with high-quality animation.</li>

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>This piece is a record and reflection of my life from <code>2023-04-19</code> to <code>2023-04-30</code>.</p>
<p>In my previous weekly review, I mentioned a journey across multiple cities. After returning to Hangzhou, I gradually resumed my original life rhythm. I had much more time alone, with plenty of input, reflection, and interesting things to do. However, it seems that I had less time to organize and dialogue with myself, often only realizing the passage of time several days later. I consider myself someone who doesn&rsquo;t rely much on socializing and has strong adaptability, but upon reflection, I might have entrusted my life state too much to the virtual world, feeling an almost disconnected discomfort from reality.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m on a late-night flight, having taken a short nap, my drowsiness gradually fading. So I decided to take out my laptop and write something. Perhaps due to the lack of internet and external distractions, my thoughts seem clearer.</p>
<h2 id="work-atmosphere-and-freedom">Work Atmosphere and Freedom</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s been over a month since I joined the new team. Perhaps because I was constantly on the move for the first two to three weeks, I often didn&rsquo;t have much sense of reality. Now I&rsquo;m gradually adapting to the rhythm and getting on track. The atmosphere in my group is very good; even when working remotely, I don&rsquo;t feel a sense of alienation. A meeting often goes from work matters to what to eat for takeout and then to what Vlog camera to buy (Sony is the way to go). Even I, usually socially anxious, have gradually become more talkative in the group chat.</p>
<p>Interestingly, due to intensive participation in the Shenzhen team building, Hong Kong Web3 Festival, and a wave of team building in Hangzhou, I&rsquo;ve already met nearly 20 colleagues from the company, which is quite remarkable for a fully remote team. I was also lucky to catch the online annual meeting, meeting many interesting colleagues who only existed in Slack dialog boxes before (all kinds of talents). A performance could uncover a rapper, and even playing Tetris could make one feel the differences between people.</p>
<p>After some communication, I made some adjustments to my work content. I can continue to do some smart contract development and chain-related research and exploration simultaneously, and also more deeply participate in the products I like (see who&rsquo;s not using <a href="https://xlog.app/">xLog</a> and <a href="https://xsync.app/">xSync</a> yet, specifically you can look at this article &ldquo;Weekly Review #25 - Personal Information Output and Synchronization System Based on Crossbell&rdquo;). Although it might require more balance in terms of workload and time, I&rsquo;m still a bit happy to have this degree of freedom of choice.</p>
<h2 id="foundry-and-contract-testing">Foundry and Contract Testing</h2>
<p>As I started to understand the projects of another group I joined for work, I quite obviously felt that although I had done some chain development and written contracts for half a year before, there was still quite a gap in complexity and development practices. I plan to supplement this area well, so this week I looked at a lot of contracts and research documents, planning to switch from Hardhat to Foundry.</p>
<p>Actually, <a href="https://twitter.com/Noy_eth">Noy</a> and some other friends had already frantically recommended the Foundry framework to me before, but because the previous project didn&rsquo;t have such high requirements for contract unit testing, and I had relied on writing many tool scripts in js, I had been using Hardhat all along. It wasn&rsquo;t until I really ran some projects and wrote some demo unit tests this time that I felt its huge advantages and instantly defected. The almost dusty Solidity contract development series is finally going to welcome a new update (<del>I&rsquo;m writing it, look at the picture if you don&rsquo;t believe me</del></p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/foundry_framework_outline.png" alt="foundry_framework_outline"></p>
<p>Actually, there are still very few enterprise-level practices for contracts at present. Also, because some of the contracts I will be doing later are open source, I plan to gradually record some experiences of pitfalls and best practices (the advantage of being full-time open source).</p>
<h2 id="logseq-and-task-management">Logseq and Task Management</h2>
<p>As my personal arrangements and work tasks have become more numerous and complex, I have reactivated Logseq as my personal task management tool. I had actually been using Notion as my personal kanban board before, but always felt that the mental burden was too heavy when using it. My severe obsessive-compulsive disorder also constantly made me optimize those task categories and description information, which actually gave me a lot of pressure. I had also used more conventional applications like TickTick and Todoist, but similarly, I still needed to sort out various tasks and tags every day, and it wasn&rsquo;t very convenient to review.</p>
<p>I later discovered the note-taking software Logseq. At first, I actually just treated it as a markdown note-taking software with blocks as the granularity, and also wanted to try out the concept of bidirectional links that always seemed to be mentioned. I got quite used to it, so I gradually migrated my Knowledge Base from Notion over. Later I also tinkered with using SimpRead to synchronize my web page annotations and such, but after a while, I still felt it was a bit troublesome so I abandoned it.</p>
<p>Until I discovered this video by <a href="https://twitter.com/randyloop">Randy</a>, &ldquo;How I Use Logseq to Manage My Life and Notes&rdquo;, he mentioned using Logseq&rsquo;s Daily Journal to make various notes and TODO management, so you don&rsquo;t need to form a plan first and then present it like with software such as Notion.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/logseq_daily_journal.png" alt="logseq_daily_journal"></p>
<p>Therefore, when you suddenly think of something you want to do, you don&rsquo;t need to create a new task separately in the kanban board or task management software, you just need to add an item in your Daily Journal like writing a note and use simple syntax like TODO, LATER to do simple task management.</p>
<p>However, some tasks span multiple days, and our tasks will be scattered under the Journal of various dates, which is not very conducive to unified management. This is where another powerful feature of Logseq comes in - Query. This feature can be understood as a query with blocks as granularity (just like sql querying a record), filtering through some tags, syntax, and other internal logic to display the blocks we want.</p>
<p>For this part, I referred to Randy&rsquo;s practice and created a Dashboard page that displays various query results. I mainly used the following Queries (the query statements are in parentheses, friends who need them can take them and modify them as needed):</p>
<ol>
<li>In Progress (<code>{{query (todo now)}}</code>)</li>
<li>Todo (<code>{{query (todo later)}}</code>)</li>
<li>Writing Plan (<code>{{query (and (todo later) [[writing]] )}}</code>)</li>
<li>Reading (<code>{{query (and (todo now) [[books]] )}}</code>)</li>
<li>Read It Later (<code>{{query (and (todo later) [[books]])}}</code>)</li>
</ol>
<p>The presentation results are as follows:</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/logseq_dashboard_in_progress.png" alt="logseq_dashboard_in_progress"></p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/logseq_dashboard_todo.png" alt="logseq_dashboard_todo"></p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/logseq_dashboard_other_queries.png" alt="logseq_dashboard_other_queries"></p>
<p>Because this is Randy&rsquo;s practice, I won&rsquo;t write a separate blog post to introduce it. I briefly introduced my own usage in the weekly review, those interested can watch his original video.</p>
<h2 id="surge-ponte-and-remote-development">Surge Ponte and Remote Development</h2>
<p>In terms of tinkering with networks, various hardware devices and systems, I belong to the category of being both unskilled and loving to play. I had explored some best practices for thin client development before, details can be seen in this article:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2022/07/05/access_your_local_devices_using_reverse_proxy_tool_frp/">Thin Client Development Workflow Based on frp Intranet Penetration</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The most core and difficult point is how to access devices at home, such as servers, Mac hosts, etc., in an external network environment. In my previous solution, I used the frp tool for intranet penetration. Half a year has passed, it&rsquo;s very stable and is still the first recommended solution.</p>
<p>But when I saw this article &ldquo;Surge Ponte Development Notes&rdquo; posted by <a href="https://twitter.com/Blankwonder">Yachen Liu</a>, I was itching to tinker again.</p>
<p>I was going to be out for a few days during the May Day holiday, and thinking that my daily development is done on the host at home, I also wanted to be able to access it when I&rsquo;m out. Just because I hadn&rsquo;t configured the frp client after reinstalling the system, I thought I might as well try Surge Ponte directly.</p>
<p>So I upgraded to Surge 5 and configured and tinkered with Surge Ponte the night before departure. After a bit of exploration, compared to frp or other similar solutions, I think Surge Ponte has absolute advantages in configuration ease of use and expansion gameplay.</p>
<p>The tinkering with Surge Ponte definitely deserves a detailed blog post, so I won&rsquo;t explain the principles and configuration details in this weekly review. I&rsquo;ll just briefly show the effects of some of the features I&rsquo;m currently using.</p>
<p>When I turned on the Surge Ponte function on both my 16-inch MBP and the Mac Studio at home (I&rsquo;m using the NAT traversal via proxy mode, which only needs a line that supports UDP, such as a self-built proxy with the Trojan protocol), I could see them in the registered devices.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/surge_ponte_config.png" alt="surge_ponte_config"></p>
<p>At this point, when the device has enabled permission for remote login, you can directly remotely log in to the host like accessing a cloud service using a command like <code>ssh [username]@[surgepontename].sgponte</code>, so it also supports VS Code remote development and such.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/surge_ponte_ssh.png" alt="surge_ponte_ssh"></p>
<p>Of course, this point can also be easily achieved by frp and others, but a more powerful point is that some services we start on the home host can also be directly accessed through a URL like <code>[surgepontename].sgponte:[port]</code>. For example, after I remotely connected to the Mac Studio at home via ssh and started a local Next.js web service, which is accessed via <code>localhost:3000</code> during local development, now I can directly access it on my MBP via <code>http://yu-macstudio.sgponte:3000</code> (although frp can also map services out, it requires writing port mapping rules on the frp client side).</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/surge_ponte_servies.png" alt="surge_ponte_servies"></p>
<p>So theoretically, by directly remotely connecting to the host via VS Code to modify code files and using the <code>[surgepontename].sgponte:[port]</code> method, you can get a full version of the local debugging experience, taking into account both portability and performance (<del>Alright, I&rsquo;m selling my MBP for an Air</del></p>
<p>Another very practical scenario is that we often have some services that can only be accessed on the local network at home, such as soft router configuration, NAS, Raspberry Pi, etc. At this time, if using frp, each one needs to be configured separately, while Surge Ponte can directly achieve external access by setting DEVICE rules. For example, I can now directly use <code>http://router.asus.com</code> to access my home router configuration page from out of town, which is very convenient for remotely managing some resident services at home.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/surge_ponte_router.png" alt="surge_ponte_router"></p>
<p>There are many more interesting applications, such as directly accessing files on home host devices through the smb protocol, etc. The later blog posts will try to cover some interesting application scenarios, interested friends can follow (<del>urge for updates</del>) the blog posts.</p>

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>This piece chronicles my life and reflections from April 3rd to April 18th, 2023.</p>
<p>Perhaps due to my recent change in lifestyle, I had planned numerous engagements as early as March. From the beginning of April, I found myself wandering, experiencing a fortnight of leisure. This journey was akin to a homecoming - departing from Hangzhou where I was raised, to Wuhan, the first place I left home for an extended period, to visit my professor and old friends, and finally to Hong Kong, where I spent some remarkable years, to attend exhibitions and events.</p>
<p>It was hardly stolen moments of leisure amidst busyness, as I didn&rsquo;t take time off work. Several workdays were spent in hotel rooms near schools or in corners of convention centers, and most travels were hurried affairs. In truth, it doesn&rsquo;t feel like I accomplished much, yet it&rsquo;s only now that I&rsquo;ve found a moment to gather my thoughts and experiences from these days.</p>
<p>The half-month journey was interesting and worthwhile. I visited my long-unseen professor and attended a nostalgic &ldquo;English Writing&rdquo; class; strolled around campus with senior Boyi, marveling at how swiftly time passes; briefly stayed in Shanghai for a night, dining with Xiaoyu and celebrating senior&rsquo;s birthday in a modest way; transited through Shenzhen, meeting many colleagues who previously existed only in work chats - a grand &ldquo;online friends meetup&rdquo;; attended the Web3 Festival in Hong Kong, and while I didn&rsquo;t meet many interesting developers, I saw some intriguing projects and caught up with both old and new friends; revisited some memory spots at HKU, still beautiful and precious; met up with Zhan in Sheung Wan and the park after a long separation; attended an electrifying Mayday concert; and many other interesting happenings.</p>
<p>Now that I&rsquo;ve returned to my usual routine, the frequency of weekly reviews and other inputs and outputs should return to normal (hopefully!).</p>
<h2 id="wuhan-chronicles">Wuhan Chronicles</h2>
<p>I actually returned to Wuhan in February, but due to circumstances, I didn&rsquo;t get to see Professor Liang. So, after a short month, I found myself back again. During my previous journey, I was anxious about interviews, but this time, with everything settled, I felt more at ease, even slowing my pace.</p>
<p>The School of Foreign Languages has always held a peculiar place in my life and memories. For a time, due to career path limitations, I was particularly reluctant to mention it, seemingly regretting why I hadn&rsquo;t chosen a more &ldquo;useful&rdquo; major. There was also a period when others would express surprise at my transition from liberal arts to coding, and to be honest, I somewhat enjoyed this label at that stage. Now, having met many interesting people with unusual experiences and having settled into my career, my past education no longer hinders my professional life. I&rsquo;ve gradually come to cherish the four years I spent at the School of Foreign Languages.</p>
<p>As my steps traced the many corners of the campus, observing the traces of various student organizations, classrooms, and studios I had been part of, I truly felt the passage of time. Some familiar events now need to be recalled in terms of five or seven years, and it&rsquo;s been a long time since I&rsquo;ve seen some people. I&rsquo;m still somewhat sentimental, often wanting to hold onto things despite knowing that forgetting is natural. I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;m attached to that period or if I envy the self that existed then - although inevitably worried, that self was full of curiosity to explore and confidence to change.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/whut_english_writing.jpg" alt="whut_english_writing"></p>
<p>Professor Liang is a particularly important figure in both my student career and life.</p>
<p>Academically, her teaching philosophy and methods truly made me feel the difference between University and High School, and completed the transformation of my learning mindset and attitude. On a personal level, she would support my explorations in various directions, entrust former students to look after me when I ventured alone to unfamiliar places, and gossip with me about all sorts of interesting things.</p>
<p>She was also my main reason for returning to Wuhan this time. I arranged to sit in on a writing class during her teaching time, seemingly returning to that period. Back then, I was busy, rushing about various affairs, confused but never afraid. I shamefully admit that I skipped or didn&rsquo;t listen to many classes at that time, thinking they were of no use to me. Looking back now, I regret it quite a bit. English literature, American literature, poetry - these only began to attract me after graduation, but I no longer had the luxury of time to read and appreciate them carefully.</p>
<h2 id="hong-kong-chronicles">Hong Kong Chronicles</h2>
<p>Another major part of my itinerary was Hong Kong. Since leaving in 2021, I&rsquo;ve always wanted to go back for a visit, but kept procrastinating. Add to that many changes in life, and the plan had gradually been shelted. This time, coinciding with the Web3 Festival in Hong Kong, I quickly decided to go.</p>
<p>As soon as I settled in, I decided to take a stroll around HKU. This was a magical year, where various aspects of myself changed significantly. I, who had long ceased using Moments, gradually began to post some daily life updates. Looking back at the few posts I made then, it seems to have divided this period of life into several stages. Even though it&rsquo;s been nearly two years, the memories remain crystal clear.</p>
<h3 id="first-arrival">First Arrival</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/just_went_to_hk_2020.png" alt="just_went_to_hk_2020"></p>
<p>The early days in Hong Kong were filled with trepidation and anticipation, curious and eager to explore every aspect of this city. I would often walk along Victoria Harbour, stopping here and there, capturing the city&rsquo;s vitality; in my small room, I would cook, study, write, content in my solitude.</p>
<p>To be honest, Hong Kong isn&rsquo;t exactly a warm city. Everyone always seems to be in a hurry, busy with their own lives and work, offering others polite but extremely restrained care. The cramped, confined spaces also make it difficult to feel truly comfortable.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/note_from_hk_landlord.png" alt="note_from_hk_landlord"></p>
<p>However, at that time, I seemed to still be a positive person, always finding interesting points in daily life, letting the light in life dispel the shadows. Particularly memorable was a note from the landlord, which I&rsquo;ve kept for many years.</p>
<h3 id="days-of-splendor">Days of Splendor</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/happy_life_in_hku.png" alt="happy_life_in_hku"></p>
<p>After a short period of adjustment, I gradually began to enjoy my new life in Hong Kong, and went through a long period of happy times.</p>
<p>I marveled at the night views of the HKU campus, couldn&rsquo;t forget the delicious Korean barbecue in Causeway Bay, collected various merchandise at the HKU Starbucks, went to Central to eat Shake Shack and watch movies, would have a drink at Quinary Bar in Lan Kwai Fong, and after rushing to meet a deadline, would bring lots of snacks and drinks to Victoria Harbour to drink until sunrise.</p>
<p>I often feel fortunate that I took a gap year before returning to campus, as it made me cherish this hard-earned pace and campus life more, becoming a special and beautiful experience in my life.</p>
<p>Particularly memorable is a dim sum restaurant called &ldquo;Chau Kee&rdquo; near the school, which I ate at many times. When I ate there again on this trip, it seemed I could taste the old Hong Kong flavor again.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/zhouji_food_02.jpg" alt="zhouji_food_01"></p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/zhouji_food_03.jpg" alt="zhouji_food_02"></p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/zhouji_food_01.jpg" alt="zhouji_food_03"></p>
<h3 id="the-long-night-approaches">The Long Night Approaches</h3>
<p>Of course, life always has its ups and downs.</p>
<p>The happy times didn&rsquo;t last too long, and life tends to quietly crumble just when we think we&rsquo;ve gotten on track.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/struggle_in_hk.png" alt="struggle_in_hk"></p>
<p>At the end of 2020, a four-year relationship ended. In early 2021, I lost my beloved grandmother, and in the middle of the year, I lost my cousin who grew up with me. At the same time, I experienced some other emotional and psychological dark moments. Life is always like this - when you think things are already bad, unexpected events tend to come one after another. During that time, I often thought of a saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;You never know whether an accident or tomorrow will come first.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The days that followed are somewhat blurry in my memory, partly due to the heavy coursework and job-seeking pressure, and partly due to the negative impact of various emotions piling up. Looking back now, I still feel that I was very unlike myself during that time - fragile, sensitive, yet cold.</p>
<p>Therefore, the latter half of my time in Hong Kong passed very quickly and hazily. I didn&rsquo;t leave many videos or photos, and didn&rsquo;t post any updates for several months. Even now, as I try to recall, these memories are gradually fading. This has been something I&rsquo;ve often regretted in the year and more since then.</p>
<h3 id="long-awaited-reunion">Long-Awaited Reunion</h3>
<h4 id="hku">HKU</h4>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/hku_zhihua_gate.jpg" alt="hku_zhihua_gate"></p>
<p>If I had to say what I remember most vividly from my entire Hong Kong period, it would be the early mornings at Chi Wah Learning Commons. I spent countless hours there, going back and forth between just two points. Every morning, to secure a seat, I would arrive early before Chi Wah opened. I often greeted the guard at the entrance with a &ldquo;zousen&rdquo; (good morning). Because I only said this one phrase, even halfway through the semester, he still thought I was a local.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/hku_starbucks.jpg" alt="hku_starbucks"></p>
<p>The coffee shop in the school is also a place that carries many memory points. I would go there every morning or afternoon for a cup of coffee. When I went this time, I still took out my student card to enjoy the discount. Back then, I would often go crazy recharging my card for some Hong Kong-limited merchandise. It&rsquo;s a pity that I couldn&rsquo;t bring back some items like mugs when I finally left.</p>
<p>I remember when I left Hong Kong, there was still some balance left on both my Octopus card and Starbucks card. But thinking that Hong Kong would be a place I would often miss and revisit, and that I would have opportunities to come back and play often, I just left them as they were. I didn&rsquo;t expect that the next time I came back would be almost two years later, and everything would no longer be the same. So, this time, as if fulfilling some kind of obsession, I cleared the balance on my Starbucks card. It was like a farewell, to that past time and memory.</p>
<h4 id="mayday-how-ive-longed-to-see-you">Mayday, How I&rsquo;ve Longed to See You</h4>
<p>The main reason for returning to Hong Kong this time was actually a Mayday concert called &ldquo;How I&rsquo;ve Longed to See You&rdquo;. Their songs have had a special significance for both my emotions and life at various stages, accompanying me through several difficult periods. With the various restrictions of the three-year pandemic, such a live performance seemed particularly precious. Even until I arrived at the venue, it still felt unreal.</p>
<p>To be honest, I feel my state hasn&rsquo;t been very good during this period. I&rsquo;ve been in a kind of indulgence after emotional accumulation, unable to settle down to do the things I want to do properly, but also not wanting to fall into a vicious cycle again. So I simply treated this half-month &ldquo;journey&rdquo; as a self-healing process. But the result wasn&rsquo;t as satisfying as I had hoped. I really enjoyed the time in Wuhan, but it was a kind of slowness of returning to the past, also like the comfort of a home, beautiful but brief. After leaving, I had to face the vast sea of life again.</p>
<p>After a period of toil, I actually found that I couldn&rsquo;t really enjoy such &ldquo;freedom&rdquo;, and it was hard to get any pure happiness from it. I even started to look forward to going home, returning to that state of focusing on my own world. Maybe it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s been so long since I&rsquo;ve had such an outing that I realized I&rsquo;ve actually been often avoiding such changes and insecurity in life. People always have their comfort zones.</p>
<p>The end point of the journey was the Mayday concert. I brought a camera, but was told at the entrance that it couldn&rsquo;t be brought in and needed to be stored in a place far away. As I was running to make it in time, I suddenly felt that relaxation and happiness I had been seeking throughout this journey. During the several hours of the performance that followed, I was in this somewhat magical state, as if a curve was gradually rising from the bottom.</p>
<p>As I was waving the light stick and singing and jumping along with Mayday, I suddenly realized that life itself doesn&rsquo;t have that many answers. Many meanings are hidden in experiences and feelings. Sometimes what we need more is to let down our guard and immerse ourselves, to explore.</p>

<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/mayday_in_hk_10.jpg" alt="mayday_in_hk_10"></p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until I got home that I started to write down my experiences from these two weeks. In my weekly reviews, I always hope to express genuine feelings rather than just record some fragments and traces of life. Several times during the journey I wanted to start writing but it always felt a bit off, so I simply put it aside.</p>
<h4 id="web3-festival">Web3 Festival</h4>
<p>I also attended the Web3 Festival. After changing jobs, I felt a particularly strong desire to go out, to meet new people, and to use this opportunity to see more possibilities in this industry.</p>
<p>I met many colleagues. Since we&rsquo;ve always been working remotely, most of them were just &ldquo;online friends&rdquo;. It was an interesting experience to have this opportunity to meet face-to-face. There were many projects on display, and I chatted with many teams. Truly interesting ones were few, and I didn&rsquo;t meet any new interesting developers, which was a bit disappointing.</p>
<p>Interestingly, while wandering around the venue, I was called out to by a friend I never expected to see - a classmate from before we were divided into science and liberal arts streams, whom I hadn&rsquo;t been in touch with for about 10 years. He said I looked a bit familiar, so he checked my Moments and saw my blue hair, so he came to say hello. After chatting, I found out he was a former employee of our company&rsquo;s closest partner. What a curious coincidence.</p>
<h2 id="nie-nies-recent-situation">Nie Nie&rsquo;s Recent Situation</h2>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/nie_nie_with_friend.jpg" alt="nie_nie_with_friend"></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been half a month since I&rsquo;ve seen her, and I miss her very much. Fortunately, my family has taken good care of both kittens, and the two kittens (one being fostered for a colleague) have become good friends. Now that I&rsquo;m back, I&rsquo;ll continue to update more about my daily life with Nie Nie.</p>
<h2 id="interesting-things-and-objects">Interesting Things and Objects</h2>
<p>Coinciding with the release of a new title, I purchased the collector&rsquo;s editions of &ldquo;Fire Emblem: Engage&rdquo; and &ldquo;Octopath Traveler II&rdquo;.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/octopath_2_collector_edition.jpg" alt="octopath_2_collector_edition"></p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/fire_emble_engage.jpg" alt="fire_emble_engage"></p>
<p>As they were shipped from Japan, I had to wait for quite a while, but the merchandise is indeed exquisite. I&rsquo;ve already put the Octopath Traveler bag to use on this trip - it&rsquo;s incredibly convenient.</p>
<h3 id="input">Input</h3>
<p>Although most interesting inputs are automatically synced to the &ldquo;Yu&rsquo;s Life&rdquo; Telegram channel, I&rsquo;ll still select a few to list here. It feels more like a newsletter this way.</p>

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>This piece is a record and reflection of my life from <code>2023-03-25</code> to <code>2023-04-02</code>.</p>
<p>Never did I imagine that as a southerner who lived in Hangzhou for over a decade, I would suffer severe adaptation issues upon returning to live in Hangzhou.</p>
<p>In the previous post, I mentioned that Nini was a bit sick due to the bumpy journey and other factors. Fortunately, after a period of adjustment, we went for a detailed check-up yesterday, and there are no issues anymore. Some nutritional supplements were prescribed for recuperation.</p>
<p>However, in the first week of settling in after moving and handling various settlement matters, my body started showing various reactions. Since I&rsquo;m the type who rarely falls ill, I didn&rsquo;t pay much attention. When I finally relaxed, everything erupted at once.</p>
<p>Other than that, I&rsquo;m adapting to the new work mode and rhythm. Due to physical and mental fatigue, I didn&rsquo;t leave myself much buffer time, so my state in work and other arrangements hasn&rsquo;t been ideal. However, I&rsquo;m in the process of self-adjustment.</p>
<p>One more sentimental note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>April without you is about to arrive. — &ldquo;Your Lie in April&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="illness">Illness</h2>
<p>After leaving the boarding school life in high school, my increasingly irregular sleep and eating habits led me to have a both casual and somewhat fearful attitude towards health. During the busiest and most multi-threaded time in college, I even had the strange idea that &ldquo;as long as I don&rsquo;t know my physical condition, I can continue to push myself with peace of mind.&rdquo; Therefore, I didn&rsquo;t have a physical examination for a long time.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until I took some time off at home that I started paying attention to it, getting a physical examination, taking care of dental issues, and addressing various big and small problems. Since then, I&rsquo;ve been somewhat more careful with my health. Interestingly, I&rsquo;ve always been the type to push my body but miraculously remain relatively healthy. Despite spending over ten hours a day staring at a computer screen, my eyesight hasn&rsquo;t deteriorated much. Without taking many precautions, I&rsquo;ve dodged several waves of the pandemic and remained uninfected. This led to a false impression that I might not get sick.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was due to the intense social dining of the previous two weeks, or drinking with friends for two consecutive days on the first weekend back, or maybe drinking a glass of cold fresh milk late at night for some reason. I started feeling some gastrointestinal discomfort on Monday but didn&rsquo;t pay much attention to it. I neither went to the hospital nor took any medication, just endured it for two days. Finally, on Wednesday and Thursday, I faced the consequences. By the afternoon, I was in so much pain that I had to lie down curled up in a ball for slight relief. My habit of staying up late, waking up early, and not napping was forcibly corrected to a healthy schedule (it didn&rsquo;t hurt when I was asleep). I finally obediently ordered some medicine and started taking it on Thursday. It only began to improve slightly the next day. It wasn&rsquo;t until I went for a check-up today that I learned it was probably acute gastroenteritis, which I had dragged out until all indicators were normal.</p>
<p>Although I didn&rsquo;t have to take sick leave in my first week of work, apart from completing some basic, not-too-difficult work tasks, I made no extra progress in other areas this week. I even felt a bit embarrassed to write this weekly review. It&rsquo;s only now, as I&rsquo;m nearing recovery, that I truly feel how good health is. I&rsquo;ll be sure to have regular check-ups and take care of my body in the future, as it greatly affects various aspects of life.</p>
<h2 id="work">Work</h2>
<p>At work, since I was already familiar with some of the people and project situations, it was more about exploring on my own based on existing materials and code. I also familiarized myself with the development process through one or two small requirements. Going forward, I&rsquo;ll be able to choose interesting requirements to develop, which is a nice approach.</p>
<p>However, my planned schedule of thoroughly reading code and getting familiar with a new module was disrupted by my illness. Overall, I&rsquo;m not too satisfied, feeling like I haven&rsquo;t quite returned to the state of focused coding. Fortunately, I&rsquo;ve almost fully recovered by the weekend, so I&rsquo;ll need to catch up more next week.</p>
<p>Perhaps due to my previous remote work experience, I adapted quickly to the remote work mode. It&rsquo;s not a new experience, but I need to refine my task management system further.</p>
<h2 id="ninis-recent-situation">Nini&rsquo;s Recent Situation</h2>
<p>In the previous post, I mentioned that Nini was sick. After two weeks of treatment, she has finally recovered. To be sure, we still took her to a nearby veterinary hospital for a complete check-up. Everything is fine, and her spirit and appetite have returned to normal.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/nie_nie_in_new_home_01.jpg" alt="nie_nie_in_new_home_01"></p>
<p>At first, Nini was a bit reserved and gloomy in the new home.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/nie_nie_in_new_home_02.jpg" alt="nie_nie_in_new_home_02"></p>
<p>After getting familiar with the environment, she seems even more relaxed than when we were in Beijing. Now she even sleeps directly on my shoulder all night or lies on the blanket next to me. I feel she&rsquo;s adapted faster than I imagined, completing the transition from a northern cat to a southern kitty.</p>
<p>Until&hellip;</p>
<p>A friend, who is going on a long trip soon, brought their kitten to my house to familiarize with the environment and for us to take care of. This way, even when I&rsquo;m out, my family can help feed and clean up. I originally thought Nini would be very happy to have a playmate, but for some reason, they don&rsquo;t get along. The two cats are always intimidating each other, quarreling, and even fighting when they&rsquo;re together. This has been going on for two days.</p>
<p>At first, Nini, as the owner of the house, seemed to cower and lose her territory, often hiding in corners or lying quietly. But for some reason, starting tonight, they both started to attack each other, and they&rsquo;ve been fighting until now.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/two_cats_fighting_01.png" alt="two_cats_fighting_01"></p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/two_cats_fighting_02.png" alt="two_cats_fighting_02"></p>
<p>Currently, both owners are emotionally unmoved and even watching and betting on the fight. Actually, it&rsquo;s mainly because they haven&rsquo;t landed a single hit on each other even after fighting for so long, it&rsquo;s all just bluffing attacks. My inner thoughts are as follows:</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/two_cats_fighting_03.gif" alt="two_cats_fighting_03"></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll report on the new battle situation next week, or hopefully, they&rsquo;ll wake up as best friends.</p>

<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/meet_with_xiao.png" alt="meet_with_xiao"></p>
<p>This weekend, I met a new friend, <a href="https://twitter.com/gxgexiao">Xiao</a>, in Hangzhou. We had read each other&rsquo;s blogs before but never met in person, so we arranged a meal together. We talked about many things, from technology to life, from work to life philosophy, from ideals to reality, from emotions to freedom. It was quite amazing.</p>
<p>Another friend mentioned earlier that they want to make an effort to meet more interesting people this month. Having been introverted for many years, I&rsquo;ve only recently realized the charm of this. Communicating with people of different experiences often brings new perspectives and ideas. Perhaps this is the value of seeking common ground while reserving differences.</p>
<p>So starting this month, I also plan to go out more and meet more interesting people. It&rsquo;s part of my plans for this new phase. However, I still need to balance the time with remote work, which I&rsquo;m still trying to figure out.</p>
<p>Over the next month, I&rsquo;ll be in Wuhan, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Hong Kong, Chengdu, and Xi&rsquo;an in succession. The schedule is packed but I&rsquo;m full of anticipation. If you&rsquo;re interested, we might meet by chance.</p>

<p>This piece is a record and reflection of my life from <code>2023-03-14</code> to <code>2023-03-23</code>.</p>
<p><del>If it weren&rsquo;t for xLog&rsquo;s incentive, I might have skipped this weekly review.</del></p>
<p>In the past week or so, a series of events unfolded: Nini fell ill, my parents drove to Beijing to pick up the cat (and me), I accompanied them sightseeing (though it was my first time at all the attractions too), met with friends before parting ways, endured a 15-hour cross-city journey, found a new apartment (though it only took an hour to sign the lease), moved and decorated the new place, and started a new job. It seemed as if everything was happening in quick succession, leaving no time to catch my breath.</p>
<p>Perhaps due to my tendency to immerse myself in aspects of work and life that I care about, I often don&rsquo;t perceive changes very clearly. Even though almost every facet of my life and state of being has changed in less than a week, I only truly felt it when I typed out the paragraph above.</p>
<p>However, not coding for nearly three weeks does make one rusty (and looking at the blank contribution chart is a bit unsettling). I need to get back into the groove. There are still many interesting things to discuss.</p>
<h2 id="featured-in-the-newspaper">Featured in the Newspaper</h2>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/yu_china_daily_report.png" alt="yu_china_daily_report"></p>
<p>Perhaps the most meaningful event this week was the publication of an interview with me in the &ldquo;China Daily · 21st Century English Edition.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not a significant achievement in itself, as it&rsquo;s not a technical contribution, and I still have a long way to go in various aspects. But for me, it holds a unique significance, or rather, it feels like a curious twist of fate.</p>
<p>In early 2018, as a junior English major, I was in a period of extreme confusion. My attempts to change majors and apply for a minor were unsuccessful, and due to the vast difference in my academic background, I was repeatedly advised against technical positions when interviewing for frontend roles at small startups. They would say, &ldquo;Your abilities are quite good, but technical positions require a relevant background. Would you consider product/operations roles instead? We can arrange an additional interview.&rdquo; It seemed I had hit a bottleneck in my self-study, feeling as though I had learned many things without direction but didn&rsquo;t know how to proceed in the future.</p>
<p>Mustering up courage, I added a computer science major English learning blogger (?) &ldquo;<a href="https://weibo.com/learnandrecord">LearnAndRecord</a>&rdquo; as a friend to seek his opinion and advice on my choices. Initially, I didn&rsquo;t have high hopes, but he patiently replied with a lot of information, including specific directions. It can be said that at that stage, he became my biggest motivation to continue on this path.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/my_chat_with_lr_2023.png" alt="my_chat_with_lr_2023"></p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/my_chat_with_lr_2018.png" alt="my_chat_with_lr_2018"></p>
<p>Later, I progressed step by step - applying to schools, receiving offers, transitioning to coding, and engaging in work I enjoyed. Of course, there were many setbacks and joys along the way, which is quite emotional to reflect upon. Coincidentally, the timing of this publication aligns with my desired move to join RSS3, allowing me to explore future possibilities and lifestyles more freely. It&rsquo;s like a milestone, telling me that everything before had meaning, that I really did it, and that it was truly worthwhile.</p>
<p>Borrowing the title of a friend&rsquo;s blog post, &ldquo;I Shall Sail Far,&rdquo; there are still many interesting things worth pursuing in the future, and I seem to be at this juncture, neither too early nor too late.</p>
<p>Additionally, after knowing &ldquo;LR&rdquo; for so many years, I finally managed to meet him for a meal. I guess that counts as successful fan behavior!!!</p>
<h2 id="moving-to-a-new-home">Moving to a New Home</h2>
<p>The place I&rsquo;ve spent the most time in these past two years has been at my desk, so I pay a lot of attention to its organization and arrangement. Because there was less than a week between my last day at the previous company and the onboarding for the new job, I only had two days to handle various matters when I returned to Hangzhou. So, I quickly chose a rental place not far from home, signed the lease, set up internet, moved, and decorated - all completed in two days. Although some household items are still missing, it&rsquo;s a preliminary achievement.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/yu_new_desk_setup.jpg" alt="yu_new_desk_setup"></p>
<p>The desk and chair were left by the property management, and I plan to replace them once everything else is settled. I&rsquo;ll adjust other things gradually! The south-facing floor-to-ceiling windows are really amazing!</p>
<p>By the way, here&rsquo;s a memorial to my previous desk setup in Beijing.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/yu_beijing_setup.jpg" alt="yu_beijing_setup"></p>
<p>Moving is quite an energy-consuming affair. This time, I was fortunate to have my parents help with the move, making it relatively smooth overall. I&rsquo;m quite satisfied with various aspects of the new home.</p>
<p>It also marks my official departure from Beijing, leaving behind a place where I&rsquo;ve created many memories and experiences. I&rsquo;ve moved between quite a few cities, and one would think I should be used to goodbyes by now, but it&rsquo;s still saddening. Wishing all the best.</p>
<h2 id="nini-fell-ill">Nini Fell Ill</h2>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/nie_nie_in_beijing_1.jpg" alt="nie_nie_in_beijing_1"></p>
<p>Starting from Saturday, Nini suddenly began vomiting. After observing for a while, we immediately took her to the vet for a check-up. It turned out to be a Helicobacter pylori infection. The vet said it wasn&rsquo;t a major issue, but it would require a period of treatment. We were still quite worried, especially since we had to take a 15-hour car ride back to Hangzhou.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/nie_nie_in_camera_1.jpg" alt="nie_nie_in_camera_1"></p>
<p>While we were out, I kept checking the home camera, but she was so active that she managed to knock out the mobile monitoring robot&rsquo;s battery. She seemed fine.</p>
<p>Fortunately, her symptoms improved after taking medication for a day, and her appetite and overall condition recovered later. She was also very well-behaved during the journey.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s about a week left in the treatment course. Hoping for a speedy recovery!</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s officially transformed from a Northern cat to a Southern kitty!</p>

<p>This piece is a record and reflection of my life from <code>2023-03-08</code> to <code>2023-03-13</code>.</p>
<p>This week was primarily focused on work handovers, which wasn&rsquo;t as busy as before, but the pressing time and impending tasks still brought considerable pressure. After all, I&rsquo;m about to leave a city I&rsquo;ve lived in for nearly two years. More time was spent on conversations and gatherings, which were rare moments of relaxation. Yet, it feels as if the constantly moving clock suddenly stopped these two weeks. I find myself quite interesting - when busy, I long for rest and relaxation, but when I can truly unburden myself, I feel somewhat at a loss.</p>
<p>Just after writing the last piece, I didn&rsquo;t learn my lesson and experienced another blackout from drinking. However, it led to an interesting experience of my colleagues piecing together clues to find my home address, which turned out to be a false alarm. It&rsquo;s become a peculiar memory point. My glasses broke, but since my prescription isn&rsquo;t strong, I simply went without them for a few days. The slightly blurry world took some getting used to, but it was manageable. Xiaoyu called and shared a lot about her recent situation. I met some new and old friends, and my home even served as a cat cafe welcoming two groups of friends. There were many other interesting happenings as well.</p>
<h2 id="dont-stop-the-clocks">Don&rsquo;t Stop the Clocks</h2>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/steve-johnson-clock.jpg" alt="steve-johnson-clock"></p>
<p>During the phone call with Xiaoyu, when I mentioned my potential plan to go to Japan for remote work and return to school to study photography - a subject I&rsquo;m fond of - she suddenly remarked that since we met in high school, perhaps because of the many things I wanted to do or achieve, I&rsquo;ve always been moving forward, never willing to stop.</p>
<p>Reflecting on it, it&rsquo;s indeed true. Even during my so-called gap year after graduating from university in 2019, I was busy doing many things, saving up for tuition. It wasn&rsquo;t really due to any pressure; my family has always been supportive of my choices. It&rsquo;s just that around my sophomore or junior year, when I truly started to ponder what I wanted to do and who I wanted to become, I unconsciously found myself in a constant state of moving forward. I wanted to make decisions about my life freely and independently. Having experienced some denials and setbacks made me want to achieve even more, or perhaps made me less willing to lose. I&rsquo;ve become so accustomed to this rhythm that I don&rsquo;t know how to stop.</p>
<p>It reminds me of a song I often listen to, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Stop the Clocks&rdquo;. Previously, my life seemed like a clock, only feeling meaningful when it was turning.</p>
<p>In my school days, I didn&rsquo;t think too much about it. With a not-so-strong foundation, I seemed to only strive continuously for better grades. During university, knowing it wasn&rsquo;t a major I liked, I actually had plenty of time but didn&rsquo;t spend much of it exploring directions. Instead, I was overly diligent in participating in various student organizations, pursuing what seemed to be the &ldquo;optimal solution&rdquo; in that environment. At most, I was in four clubs, with five or six meetings a week. Just as I was about to enter my senior year, when I could have slowed down, I started my own video studio business, returning to a busy state. Upon graduation, I realized I still wasn&rsquo;t willing to casually take up a job I didn&rsquo;t like, so I embarked on a gap year, preparing for graduate school applications. Even after receiving an offer early, I was always anxious. Before going to Hong Kong, I repeatedly told myself that it might be my last student life experience and that I should enjoy it fully, but I couldn&rsquo;t really do so. From January, when the second semester started, I constantly worried about internships and jobs. After starting work, being my first formal technical job, I never dared to slack off, seemingly trying to prove to others and myself that I could walk this path well.</p>
<p>In terms of results, all this progress seems to have been meaningful. It brought decent college entrance exam scores that allowed me to enter a good university environment, good undergraduate grades and resume that didn&rsquo;t constrain me when applying for graduate school, decent technical accumulation that gives me the opportunity to pursue directions I like, and many other things. But the cost, as Xiaoyu said, was &ldquo;You always seem so tired.&rdquo; Indeed, it has been quite tiring. I don&rsquo;t want to say something cliché like it was all worth it; it&rsquo;s just a journey with gains and losses.</p>
<p>Now, in this rare and precious gap week between two jobs, I&rsquo;m finally willing to slow down my pace, to do and think about things without so much concern for gain or loss. I stay up late binge-watching shows, then stubbornly resist Nini&rsquo;s attempts to wake me up for breakfast the next morning. I turn my rental into a cat cafe, hosting two groups of visitors in one weekend. I open my Switch that hasn&rsquo;t been touched for months and spend an afternoon playing &ldquo;It Takes Two&rdquo; with a friend (it&rsquo;s really fun!).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>時計の針を進めて。
Let the clock&rsquo;s hands continue to move forward.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even now, I still tell myself, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Stop the Clocks,&rdquo; because there are still many interesting things in the future worth pursuing. However, I also often remind myself not to always look ahead, but to experience more of the people and things around me. They are the markings that make life flow and give it meaning. Every moment is worth cherishing, even the &ldquo;wasted&rdquo; ones.</p>

<p>My middle school homeroom teacher, Brother Chun, wanted to demonstrate ChatGPT to his students (or maybe he wanted to use ChatGPT to help with lesson preparation lazily), so I set up a service for direct access in the domestic network environment.

<p>This piece is a record and reflection of my life from <code>2023-02-27</code> to <code>2023-03-07</code>.</p>
<p>This week has brought significant changes to my life, and for various reasons, I&rsquo;m about to leave Beijing. With many things to handle, I&rsquo;ve been updating Twitter and my Telegram channel less frequently, and even GitHub has seen unusually long periods of inactivity.</p>
<p>Overall, though, it&rsquo;s a positive trend. I&rsquo;ve rescued myself from the inertia of a certain lifestyle and discovered that my mindset has changed considerably over the past half year. The old me would only go out once every few weeks, hadn&rsquo;t been anywhere in Beijing for almost two years despite living here, and still had only a handful of friends. I even felt a sense of mental discomfort just getting off the high-speed train when returning to Beijing from Hangzhou. Yet, now that I&rsquo;m truly about to leave this city, I find there are quite a few people and things worth missing.</p>
<p>I visited an exhibition, went out for drinks twice, had several gatherings, met some people, and experienced many interesting things.</p>
<h2 id="beijing-x-story-x-farewell">Beijing x Story x Farewell</h2>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/tokyo_love_story.png" alt="tokyo_love_story"></p>
<p>My favorite Japanese drama is called &ldquo;Tokyo Love Story,&rdquo; from &lsquo;91 or &lsquo;92. It&rsquo;s quite old now. I love how just a few characters can sketch out all the impressions of a city. Of course, the main reason is that I&rsquo;m too fond of Rika, and I often see reflections of myself in Kanji.</p>
<p>In my twenty-some years of life, I&rsquo;ve had fleeting encounters with several cities. Even for Hangzhou, where I lived for over a decade, I never felt that the city itself left much of an impression or sense of belonging - it was always about the people. In the previous piece, I wrote about Wuhan, and this time, let&rsquo;s talk about Beijing. Although I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m fond of it, I&rsquo;ve experienced a lot here, and it&rsquo;s still worth a dedicated theme. Its significance to me may be far more than just love, so I&rsquo;ve titled it &ldquo;Beijing x Story x Farewell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I never imagined I&rsquo;d have much connection with Beijing. My only previous impression was from November 2018, when I attended an exhibition at the Beijing Exhibition Center. Coming from Wuhan, I misjudged the temperature and found myself shivering as I exited the station, which wasn&rsquo;t exactly a good first impression.</p>
<p>The next time was in 2021, nearing graduation. Partly due to emotional factors, I started considering work in Beijing. Without much deep thought, and with a decent opportunity presenting itself, I decided on my temporary home for the next two years in just a few days.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always felt rather detached from cities, often thinking there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with feeling at home anywhere. But the dilapidated feeling upon exiting Beijing West Station and the summer heat didn&rsquo;t do much to improve my impression. Then came finding an apartment, starting work, and commuting between two points - everything seemed to happen naturally.</p>
<p>I seem to carry some lucky charm with me. The landlord is nice, allowing pets, and never interferes except to collect rent, yet is always available when there are issues at home. The company was originally an hour&rsquo;s commute away, but after six months, it moved to Sanlitun, with plenty of food and entertainment options, and now only a 40-minute commute. My leader gave me a high degree of freedom, allowing me to explore freely over the past year and more. Experienced colleagues looked after me at work, staying late together and often gathering for meals, making the work environment, which occupied most of my life, feel less constraining. The product and test colleagues in the meeting room were also interesting, always saying, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t frown, tell your sisters what&rsquo;s bothering you,&rdquo; and even giving me a Bumblebee toy on my birthday. Although projects were often challenging, each one allowed me to meet like-minded people, and even after overcoming the difficulties between client and supplier, we still maintained personal connections.</p>
<p>Luck is always limited, or perhaps always balanced. Or maybe my past self borrowed some luck from the future.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve experienced times when, due to a breakup and other reasons, I stayed home for two months, losing 10 pounds, only able to sleep for two to three hours a day with the help of melatonin. There were times when I was dissatisfied with my work and life state, anxious until late at night before slowly falling asleep, only to wake up sleepless and dazed not long after. There were also times when, after drinking a lot at a company project dinner, I took a taxi home, only to find myself waking up in some corner of the residential area after sleeping for a few hours, struggling to get back to my room to clean up the mess, and even having to pay a few hundred yuan to the community&rsquo;s uncle to redeem my phone left on the road when I woke up.</p>
<p>In these somewhat unfortunate moments, I couldn&rsquo;t help but wonder, why bother? Why stay in a place that seems to always evoke memories of the past? Why stay in a place where I seem to have no motivation even to go out? Why stay in a place where I might not know who to call for help if something happened to me? Why bother?</p>
<p>For a period after that, I stayed cooped up at home. It seemed to not matter which city I was in, and even the change of seasons became blurred. Even now, I still haven&rsquo;t been to places like the Forbidden City, the Old Summer Palace, or Universal Studios. I&rsquo;ve been living like someone who&rsquo;s just been staying in this city for an extended period. Even as I&rsquo;m about to leave this city, I still don&rsquo;t have much attachment to it. I&rsquo;ve just gradually accumulated some people and memories to cherish. Perhaps I&rsquo;m still not too accustomed to farewells; as the set date approaches, my mood tends to become heavier.</p>
<p>Life often resembles casually drawn lines, sometimes sparse, sometimes dense. Some intersect, while others diverge. But perhaps these elements together constitute the original appearance of life. As people grow older, life gradually reveals its true face - real, cruel, yet unavoidable.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I always thought my mindset was quite stable, but it turns out that when something I really want to succeed at appears in my life after a long time, I still get anxious to the point of needing to listen to music constantly to relieve the stress.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps because life after work has gradually become stable, I haven&rsquo;t had much emotional fluctuation. I&rsquo;ve even gotten used to putting myself under high pressure, so it&rsquo;s been a long time since I&rsquo;ve experienced the feeling of anxiety. Recently, however, I&rsquo;ve truly felt this extreme sense of anxiety. Maybe it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s something I really want to achieve, making it difficult to maintain a calm attitude.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/bar_with_rain.jpg" alt="bar_with_rain"></p>
<p>Fortunately, it turned out well in the end. It wasn&rsquo;t until the moment when the weight truly lifted from my heart that I realized how much pressure I had accumulated. I went to a bar with friends, drinking one glass after another, as if trying to let all the pressure dissipate with the alcohol.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/meal_with_homura.png" alt="meal_with_homura"></p>

<p>Had meals with <a href="https://twitter.com/RealAkemiHomura">@RealAkemiHomura</a> twice, walked and talked a lot. Although I&rsquo;ve always thought of myself as not very social, it&rsquo;s only when I&rsquo;m about to leave Beijing that I realize there are still some people I want to see.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/tiao_hai_exhibition.jpg" alt="tiao_hai_exhibition"></p>
<p>The weekend was unusually rich. I went out for barbecue with a client friend from a previous project, but as we were leaving, we were attracted by a comic exhibition we happened to glimpse downstairs. It turned out to be an unexpectedly interesting activity, and we spent the afternoon watching girls dance. As someone in the late stages of social phobia, I met two friends of my senior Boyi in the evening and felt that I might be improving a bit, which made me happy. After dinner, we went to the Tiaohai Bar to see a personal art exhibition by a friend from my senior&rsquo;s art studio. I even won a micro-printed version of a painting in a lucky draw, which was also a very interesting experience.</p>
<p>Borrowing the first few words from the theme of this personal art exhibition, &ldquo;Breaking out of Life,&rdquo; my recent state seems to be about regaining expectations for everything through such means. Life may inherently come with many adversities, but ultimately, it requires the courage to break through.</p>
<p>It also reminds me of a line from &ldquo;The Book of Time&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Young man, your duty is to level the ground, not to worry about time. What you do in March and April will have answers in August and September.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I remember it was originally about solar terms, but now it&rsquo;s just March and April, which is quite fitting.</p>
<p>In summary, although I didn&rsquo;t do much serious work this week, I didn&rsquo;t miss out on eating, drinking, playing, or having fun.</p>

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>This is a record and reflection of my life from <code>2023-02-21</code> to <code>2023-02-26</code>.</p>
<p>This week was relatively routine in terms of work, with no particularly urgent tasks. Despite being in a somewhat tense state due to personal matters, I felt less anxious and depressed. Perhaps there was a sense that everything was on the right track.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, Jingru suddenly messaged asking if I could come to Wuhan on the weekend of the 23rd-25th, as she and Qu would both be there. The thought of seeing each other again led to another spontaneous &ldquo;trip&rdquo; without much hesitation. I returned to the school and college, meeting some old teachers and friends. Due to the lost three years of the pandemic, it now seems that when I recall the last time I met some friends, it&rsquo;s been a bewildering three or four years.</p>
<p>This time in Wuhan, I only spent Friday and Saturday, a short time, yet it was my first purely leisure trip in two years. There was a peculiar feeling, as if I was once again sensing the flow of life and my own emotions, while also reflecting on my own changes from another perspective.</p>
<h2 id="wuhan">Wuhan</h2>
<p>In June 2015, as I filled out my college application, I flipped through a small booklet issued by the school, which contained introductions to all universities and their historical admission scores. I somewhat hastily chose the city where I would spend the next few years. It didn&rsquo;t take long to decide on Wuhan, probably partly due to my longing for the humanistic atmosphere of Wuhan University (I fell short on scores, so I chose a school with two more characters in its name), which in turn gave the city a unique appeal.</p>
<p>Although I feel somewhat ashamed that I didn&rsquo;t put much effort into my studies and don&rsquo;t have any particularly memorable achievements, the time I spent in Wuhan has unconsciously become a very important part of my life. When I graduated, since most people around me had also left Wuhan for various places, I once thought that even if I had no more connection with this city in the future, it wouldn&rsquo;t matter much. What&rsquo;s important are the memories and relationships.</p>
<p>But on this return to Wuhan, from getting off at Wuhan Station, to changing subway lines and passing through familiar station names, to that street I had walked thousands of times and the college classrooms, I realized that this city and everything in it had already been etched into my life. I felt a long-lost sense of &ldquo;return&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Perhaps it&rsquo;s not quite a sense of belonging. From the moment I arrived in this city alone, dragging my suitcase, I knew I was just a temporary resident here. I didn&rsquo;t even have many expectations for this city, and when I left, what saddened me was only the parting from these familiar people. But soon after, the pandemic broke out. Lockdowns, makeshift hospitals, and many heartbreaking news even happened to people I knew, and the city seemed to gradually be covered in a layer of gray.</p>
<p>At that time, I was in Hangzhou, watching the flood of negative news online, as well as more insults and implicit discrimination against Wuhan. I felt a real sense of heartache and helplessness. A city that was once full of so many colors was now being presented to everyone in this way. There are so many things worth mentioning about Wuhan: the &ldquo;early breakfast&rdquo; culture of Liangdao Street, hot dry noodles and Zhou Heiya, the imposing Wuhan dialect, the hot-tempered yet straightforward Wuhan bus drivers (although I was nearly thrown from the back to the middle by one sudden brake), the Yangtze River Bridge that legend says will lead to lifelong companionship if you walk across it together (I&rsquo;ve walked it a few times, it&rsquo;s quite windy and good exercise, but not much else), the prosperity of Jianghan Road and the leisurely moments by the river, the bustle of Optics Valley and its puzzling traffic conditions. There are many interesting points or things to joke about, and I would tell friends that this city is worth experiencing for themselves, multifaceted and uniquely charming. But because of this pandemic, Wuhan seems to have gradually lost this sense of mystery, and even left some people with fixed impressions, which makes me feel quite complex.</p>
<p>Wuhan will not become my second home, but it will always be a resting place on my journey home. When I&rsquo;m tired, perhaps I&rsquo;ll go back to see it and pick up my life again.</p>
<h2 id="long-awaited-reunions-and-flowing-emotions">Long-Awaited Reunions and Flowing Emotions</h2>
<p>In a previous article, &ldquo;<a href="https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2022/08/29/weekly_review_20220829/">Weekly Review #09 - Colorless Yu and His Year of Pilgrimage</a>&rdquo;, I mentioned a group of people:</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/four_people_relationship.png" alt="four_people_relationship"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>People always seem to have a tendency to form groups at various stages, and once dependent on a group, one inevitably suffers from the pressure and frustration of relationships. In college, I had such a group of four, two boys and two girls, always inseparable. When the counselor or classmates found someone missing, they would naturally ask the others.</p>
<p>But after a while, I felt obvious pressure. The other three seemed to be more prominent figures, always the ones shining in the crowd, while I always seemed to lack presence. Internally, I didn&rsquo;t want to be the redundant one who was there out of habit. So I started to deliberately avoid and escape, of course, my clumsy performance couldn&rsquo;t hide it, and it was quickly noticed.</p>
<p>I was luckier than Tsukuru Tazaki in that I wasn&rsquo;t abandoned, nor were there any misunderstandings. The other three cornered me at the boys&rsquo; dormitory one night and made me speak out my concerns, addressing them one by one. I might still feel that the responses about personality and presence were just comfort, but I felt that I was needed in this relationship and pattern, that my emotions were taken seriously by them, that our relationship was cherished. Even though we later had few opportunities to act together due to cities and many reasons, we still maintain good contact, and they are the first people we think of when we arrive in any member&rsquo;s city.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are the people I met in Wuhan this time.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/photo_with_ru_qu_and_lei.jpg" alt="photo_with_ru_qu_and_lei"></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always cherished this kind of natural and comfortable relationship, the kind where a simple &ldquo;I miss you&rdquo; can lead to a meeting. It doesn&rsquo;t need much deliberate rhetoric or arrangement. Ni, Zhan, Xiaoyu and them are all like this, even though we haven&rsquo;t been able to meet for three or four years due to the pandemic.</p>
<p>When I was in Hong Kong, I received a sudden video call one night, the three of them were gathering in Wuhan, and I took a remote group photo via WeChat video. This time, I was finally able to be there in person. Eating, drinking, wandering leisurely around the campus, talking about the past and present, everything was as before. The trip was hurried, I returned to Beijing on Sunday, hoping we can meet more often.</p>
<p>Apart from meeting, I seem to have discovered some changes in myself during this brief trip. I&rsquo;m more willing to feel the things around me, more frequently delighted by some inconspicuous little things or even a song I happen to hear while walking down a certain road. Even though I&rsquo;m currently surrounded by some anxiety-worthy things, my emotions seem to have gradually started flowing with the journey.</p>
<p>I hope to have more opportunities for travel in the future.</p>
<h2 id="interesting-things-and-objects">Interesting Things and Objects</h2>
<h3 id="cyber-moving">Cyber Moving</h3>
<p>Perhaps it&rsquo;s due to some doubts about domestic internet companies and some services oriented towards China, over the past six months I&rsquo;ve been gradually moving all the services I rely on overseas as much as possible. Although most are still centralized, at least there&rsquo;s less concern about censorship and privacy protection.</p>
<p>During this week in Wuhan, I finally moved iCloud, which I relied on the most and was the most troublesome to move, from Guizhou Cloud to the Hong Kong region. It went through quite a few twists and turns. I have to say that Apple&rsquo;s account management and cloud service synchronization are really not good in this aspect.</p>
<p>Because my account has bought many software (including Final Cut Pro X and other suite products), I didn&rsquo;t want to open a new account just for migration. Fortunately, Apple&rsquo;s region change can retain purchased items, and all the Apps I bought in the China region are also available in the Hong Kong region, which is actually quite seamless in this respect.</p>
<p>But Apple&rsquo;s family sharing is not so convenient. Previously, my account opened a Family and shared 200G iCloud with Ni and Zhan for common use, and also monitored my sister&rsquo;s account (because she&rsquo;s under 14). When I wanted to change regions, I needed to first transfer my sister&rsquo;s account to another family, and wait for my subscribed Apple Music to expire (couldn&rsquo;t even do it in advance, could only wait until the end of the current month&rsquo;s subscription cycle, which is a bit ridiculous), then use Hong Kong region payment methods and various information to change the region, and then enable Hong Kong region family sharing iCloud.</p>
<p>Not only was the process somewhat troublesome, but when logging in to the account again, the iPhone also had a verification error. After checking a lot of information, they all said it could only be restored to factory settings, so I had to spend a night tinkering with the software. Fortunately, I had recorded it in the <a href="https://github.com/pseudoyu/yu-tools">toolbox project</a> before, but it was still painful to reset all permissions/applications. Fortunately, it was finally resolved. I feel this is something that had to be done sooner or later.</p>
<p>The other phone is OnePlus 7 Pro, which I bought several years ago. As soon as I got it, I tinkered with it and flashed the overseas version of Oxygen OS to use the Google suite. Maybe domestic manufacturers and some services have made me reach a point of mental cleanliness.</p>

<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/yu_hug_other_cat.jpg" alt="yu_hug_other_cat"></p>

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>This piece is a record and reflection of my life from February 13, 2023 to February 20, 2023.</p>
<p>This week was exceptionally full with work and various personal projects. Although I wasn&rsquo;t truly busy to the point of having no time to sleep, I developed an inexplicable sense of anxiety and low mood, often leading to a tendency for revenge bedtime procrastination. Looking at my phone&rsquo;s sleep record, I averaged less than 3 hours of sleep per day.</p>
<p>This week, Valentine&rsquo;s Day triggered some emotions through the Douban Movie Calendar, reminding me of past events. I made up my mind to tinker a bit and bought ChatGPT Plus, which, combined with GitHub Copilot, saved me a lot of repetitive work. Because I&rsquo;ve been fiddling with this recently, I even went to BoYi&rsquo;s financial live streaming room to popularize AIGC and ChatGPT for an hour - my live streaming debut, quite a novel experience. On the weekend, feeling too depressed, I went to the Sea Dive Bar with friends for some drinks, a rare moment of relaxation. My previous side project was severely delayed, leading to almost two sleepless nights over the weekend, frantically writing front-end code. I joined the development team for Cusdis v2 and wrote my first feature. Strangely, as a backend developer, my first PR for a relatively large open-source project turned out to be for Next.js, which was quite unexpected. There were many other interesting things as well.</p>
<h2 id="open-source-and-front-end-learning">Open Source and Front-end Learning</h2>
<p>Although I seem to be quite active on GitHub, Twitter, and my blog, due to my relatively short work experience and my current job not being open-source in nature, I haven&rsquo;t really participated in any large open-source projects in terms of code contributions. Instead, I&rsquo;ve gained quite a few stars for some Markdown and course assignment projects, which often makes me feel a bit embarrassed.</p>
<p>So at the beginning of this year, I set some goals to participate in various forms of open-source projects that interest me. This included setting an open-source budget for myself last week (see &ldquo;Weekly Review #30 - Open Source Budget, Writing Aspirations, and Humility Towards Technology&rdquo;). I also raised some issues for RSS3, which is a good start.</p>
<p>An interesting thing happened when I saw Randy on Twitter looking for partners to develop Cusdis v2. I&rsquo;ve been using Cusdis for almost two years now (i.e., the comment system for this blog), and I really like this simple yet powerful system. I&rsquo;ve also helped some friends create or solve some deployment and usage issues, almost becoming a walking advertisement for it.</p>
<p>Although I&rsquo;m not a front-end developer, I was so interested that I joined the TG chat. Randy is truly a pure technologist and very friendly. After I briefly stated my situation and thoughts, he asked me to pull the latest code first and get it running before we talked further (suddenly feeling like an interview).</p>
<p>I briefly looked at the code structure and commands. Because I had been using the JavaScript-based Hardhat framework for writing Solidity, and had learned about TypeScript when studying front-end later, I was quite familiar with package installation management and some basic commands. The only difference was switching from yarn to pnpm. After tinkering with the environment a bit and starting a PostgreSQL instance on the server using Docker, I got it running (later I found out that local sqlite would have been sufficient, no need for such a roundabout way).</p>
<p>Then he asked me to look at the current basic functions and see which part I was more interested in. So I started slowly reading the code and even raised some v1 version bugs to him (which were quickly fixed, showing powerful execution). Then work projects got busy, so I didn&rsquo;t start writing, but during this time I read a small book on Next.js development written by Randy:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://nextjs-in-action-cn.taonan.lu/">Next.js Application Development Practice</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This book is really super good. It&rsquo;s the clearest explanation I&rsquo;ve seen on code practices since I started writing Next.js. It covers best practices such as Query, Mutation, and using Query Invalidation to force data refresh, and also recommends Prisma, a super useful ORM library. The theoretical explanations at the beginning are very clear and easy to understand, and there are two example projects attached at the end, which are very worth reading.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/side_project_api_structure.png" alt="side_project_api_structure"></p>
<p>After reading this book, I abandoned the Go backend of my half-done Side Project and spent an entire weekend restructuring the backend logic implementation part in the Next.js api module using Prisma to connect to the PostgreSQL database. At first, I felt a bit uncomfortable, looking at the code in that little book and modifying it accordingly for user management and authentication. Later, the other functions became more handy, and it was also a relatively complete practice. I must praise the combination of Next.js + TailwindCSS + Prisma for bringing a very good development experience, very suitable for independently developing some projects.</p>
<p>After two days of intense coding over the weekend, my confidence in front-end implementation also grew considerably. So I went to Randy to take on a development task. The function wasn&rsquo;t complicated, just using Mutation to implement the logic for users to save the Webhook connection configuration needed for comment notifications, and adding some loading states and toast notifications. But it was still a good start.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/chat_with_randy_01.png" alt="chat_with_randy_01"></p>
<p>I encountered some problems during the implementation and consulted him, and he gave patient answers. Finally, I completed this PR in the evening.</p>

<p>This kind of experience is quite interesting. Trying to participate in open source when I had hardly written any front-end projects, I received help and guidance from developers I greatly admire. Sometimes being proactive can lead to unexpected gains. However, thinking that as a blockchain backend developer, my first contribution to a relatively large open-source project and my first functional PR turned out to be front-end, it&rsquo;s quite a peculiar experience.</p>

<h2 id="chatgpt">ChatGPT</h2>
<p>I was an early beta tester for GitHub Copilot, and was amazed the first time I used it. I couldn&rsquo;t believe AI could already do so much in terms of code. I&rsquo;ve been using it continuously since then, for about a year and a half now. Later, I also frequently used DeepL&rsquo;s machine translation, which I feel is much better quality than Google Translate, and it has helped me complete many open-source translation projects. After that came Notion AI, but because I later completely moved from Notion to Logseq, I just tried it out and then set it aside. Similar to this is Craft, an online note-taking software I bought during Black Friday, which also has a built-in assistant to optimize text. But the most heavyweight of all is undoubtedly ChatGPT, which was launched at the end of last year.</p>
<p>I remember it was launched around the end of November, and I started experiencing it in early December after getting a phone verification code from Ni in Australia. At that time, I often used it to ask code questions, and it could basically give fairly accurate answers. But because I actually prefer the more seamless approach of GitHub Copilot, and didn&rsquo;t want to organize a bunch of language to ask questions every time and then paste the code back for editing, I played with it for a while and then set it aside, only occasionally opening it to look at some new technologies.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/chatgpt_assistant_usage.png" alt="chatgpt_assistant_usage"></p>
<p>Last week, I happened to see <a href="https://twitter.com/hzlzh">Zili</a> using ChatGPT as an assistant, which was very tempting. After some tinkering with virtual credit cards and such, I finally got the Plus membership. The not-so-cheap expense of $20 a month made me start to sort out my daily usage needs. In the end, I divided programming code questions, Japanese learning, Chinese-English translation, search engine, copywriting optimization and other needs into multiple dialogue boxes for use. Every day it&rsquo;s like having a bunch of little assistants, quite lively.</p>
<p>Recently, I&rsquo;ve had a lot of front-end work to do. Although I&rsquo;ve taken courses and studied before, there are still many details I&rsquo;m not very clear about. At this time, asking questions to ChatGPT and filtering the correct answers from its responses and digesting them into my own knowledge is actually quite effective. It&rsquo;s also very practical, and often proposes novel implementation ideas. Language learning should be the same principle, but I haven&rsquo;t had time to properly test the effect of Japanese learning. If it&rsquo;s interesting later, I might record some dialogues.</p>

<p>Over the weekend, I went to the Sea Dive Bar with friends. It&rsquo;s a small bar in a hutong, crowded but not noisy, with its own kind of liveliness. Inside, there&rsquo;s a big sign that says &ldquo;Someone&rsquo;s Diving&rdquo;. I had a long chat with a friend who happened to be in Beijing on a business trip, which eased some of the gloomy emotions I&rsquo;d been carrying this week. I need to adjust well for the new week.</p>

<p>I had some drinks at the &ldquo;Sea Dive Bar&rdquo; and got home around 1 AM, falling asleep soon after. I just opened my eyes groggily to find Nie Nie seemingly sniffing at my face intently, occasionally touching me tentatively with her little paw. It took my brain (after rebooting) a while to realize she was worried about whether I was still alive. I hurriedly opened my phone in the dark to snap a picture, suddenly feeling a bit of long-lost warmth and dependence.</p>

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>This is a record and reflection of my life from <code>2023-02-07</code> to <code>2023-02-12</code>.</p>
<p>This week saw little progress in work, yet the time after the New Year seemed to pass particularly quickly. Though it felt like I hadn&rsquo;t accomplished much of value, I found myself in a state of busyness. I finally started investing considerable time in handling additional projects, which deviated from my original expectations and brought some anxiety, which I&rsquo;m slowly working through.</p>
<p>This week, at the request of the company&rsquo;s operations team, I wrote an article about Cosmos. The writing and publishing process sparked some realizations about my attitude, leading to reflections on my original writing motivation and humility towards technology.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, I attended a concert at the National Centre for the Performing Arts. I had long wanted to listen to a symphony orchestra but rarely had the opportunity, so I finally discovered a new weekend destination. I also chatted with Randy, the creator of my current comment system <a href="https://cusdis.com/">Cusdis</a> (and reported a few bugs). He struck me as a pure technologist, and I hope to contribute to the development of Cusdis v2. There were many other interesting events as well.</p>
<h2 id="open-source-budget">Open Source Budget</h2>
<p>In Randy&rsquo;s article &ldquo;<a href="https://lutaonan.com/blog/my-oss-donation-budget/">I Set Myself a $20 Monthly Open Source Donation Budget</a>&rdquo;, I saw his philosophy and attitude towards open source projects, which I found intriguing and inspired me to establish a similar open source budget for myself.</p>
<p>My current plan is to set aside at least $20 (about 130 RMB) or an equivalent value budget per month, flexibly choosing based on my daily use and tech stack. I will select the following projects for donation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Independent bloggers and developers who have inspired me</li>
<li>Projects that I frequently use in my side projects and have solved concrete problems</li>
<li>Interesting open source tools and services that I use frequently</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently, the projects I&rsquo;m donating to are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/reorx">Reorx</a>, a developer I greatly admire. His independent blog, attitude towards tools and exploration, and some of the projects he&rsquo;s developed have been immensely beneficial to me. My &ldquo;<a href="https://t.me/pseudoyulife">Yu&rsquo;s Life</a>&rdquo; channel is forked from his &ldquo;<a href="https://t.me/reorx_share">Reorx&rsquo;s Footprints</a>&rdquo;, which has reshaped my information input and output flow over the past six months. His recently released &ldquo;<a href="https://github.com/reorx/jsoncv">GitHub - jsoncv</a>&rdquo; also came in handy when I was restructuring my resume.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/immersive-translate/immersive-translate">immersive-translate</a>, an immersive translation plugin led by <a href="https://www.owenyoung.com/">owen</a>. It&rsquo;s an interesting tool, and owen is diligently developing the v2 version. I joined the team early on and am now taking on some development requirements. When I learned during team discussions that some servers were needed, I provided two.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="writing-motivation">Writing Motivation</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always enjoyed writing, especially in the past six months when my output has reached a decent frequency and quality. Through long-term blogging, I&rsquo;ve made many friends and occasionally received some good opportunities. But as my writing skills have improved with accumulation and I&rsquo;ve often received positive feedback, I seem to have fallen into a writing trap at times. A recent incident gave me a wake-up call.</p>
<p>The company&rsquo;s media operations team commissioned an article from me before the New Year, with no restriction on the theme as long as it was related to the company&rsquo;s business technology. I agreed at the time because I had plenty of time, but I put it aside during the New Year holiday. When I was urged to submit after returning to work in Beijing, I remembered but didn&rsquo;t want to do a perfunctory job. So I chose a major theme of Cosmos underlying chain and consensus analysis, and spent an evening writing it.</p>
<p>There wasn&rsquo;t much to it when I submitted the draft, as most of the knowledge points were derived from summarizing and organizing a book. I thought there might only be some minor adjustments to details. However, when it was handed over to a leader well-versed in underlying chains for review, the following dialogue ensued.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/zgtech_cosmos_article_review_kai.png" alt="zgtech_cosmos_article_review_kai"></p>
<p>Upon checking the shared link used for proofreading, I found that he had made very detailed annotations on some questionable details in my article, many parts with papers and citations.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/zgtech_cosmos_article_review_3.png" alt="zgtech_cosmos_article_review_3"></p>
<p>At first, I just wondered if I had been too blindly trusting of the books I read and knowledge points, lacking the spirit of doubt and verification that I should have had.</p>
<p>Reflecting further on the entire process of this incident, I realized that my mindset had undergone some subtle changes. I seem to have always been quite adept at wielding words, sometimes organizing and summarizing knowledge points and presenting them in an easily readable and interesting way, sometimes expressing and presenting some of my own ideas and thoughts through words.</p>
<p>Words seem to have become my habitual mode of expression, and because of the considerable positive feedback, I seem to have lost sight of my original purpose somewhat. Writing itself stems from the exploration and presentation of life and some things and technologies, and secondarily from sharing and creating value for others. I seem to have gradually made sharing an end in itself.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a saying in the Analects of Confucius:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;When substance prevails over form, we have rusticity; when form prevails over substance, we have pedantry. Only when substance and form are properly blended do we have the superior man.&rdquo; — Analects of Confucius, Chapter 6</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is quite applicable to writing. When substance (the meat of the content in writing) is too much and form (literary flair/technique) is too little, it lacks the pleasure of drawing people in to keep reading and loses the charm of writing; when form exceeds substance, it tends to be hollow, lacking substantive content, and loses the meaning of writing. Only when form and substance are well-balanced can we say it&rsquo;s a good article.</p>
<p>I think I may be more or less worried about tilting towards form over substance, but fortunately, this incident served as a timely warning. In the future, I will be more cautious with my words.</p>
<h2 id="humility-towards-technology">Humility Towards Technology</h2>
<p>This actually relates to a quite discussable topic, namely, the humility towards technology.</p>
<p>I think people in this industry can more or less realize the boundlessness of technology. Getting started with programming or making it a profession is just the beginning; there are too many people worthy of admiration and too many interesting technologies.</p>
<p>I actually entered this industry with a filter. When I was still an English major undergraduate, I had too many fantasies and expectations for this industry and profession. Therefore, after I got into development work as I wished, I often reminded myself to always have a humble heart towards technology.</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;ve seen too many full-stack open-source masters calling themselves &ldquo;front-end developers who can write a bit of back-end&rdquo; or &ldquo;making little things that people like&rdquo;, I really like this attitude. Technology itself is a means of fun and realizing one&rsquo;s ideas, not a tool that needs to be shown off. Only by holding such a concept towards technology can one continuously learn and grow.</p>
<h2 id="interesting-things">Interesting Things</h2>
<h3 id="software">Software</h3>
<p>I used to use Apple Music a lot, but some of its operational logic is really frustrating. The playlist function is practically useless, and due to some closed nature of the interface, it&rsquo;s difficult to access your own data. Therefore, even though my Telegram channel was originally configured to automatically sync liked songs from Spotify, each time I would hear a good song on Apple Music, I would go to Spotify to search for it. And due to the ads in the free version and the limitations on skipping songs during trials, it was very troublesome, so I rarely synced my songs.</p>

<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/spotfiy_service_family_mail.png" alt="spotfiy_service_family_mail"></p>
<p>Recently, Ni, Zhan, and I are migrating our iCloud Family to escape Cloud on Guizhou. After stopping the original service and comparing prices in the Hong Kong region, we found it&rsquo;s better to just migrate to Spotify. So I happily got Spotify Premium, which is much more comfortable to use. Plus, after watching the &ldquo;<a href="https://movie.douban.com/subject/35500137/">The Playlist</a>&rdquo; series earlier, there&rsquo;s always a strange sense of participation!</p>
<p>Along with the Netflix family membership that Zhan got from his Hong Kong broadband subscription, the audio-visual entertainment aspect now has a seamless experience!</p>
<h3 id="input">Input</h3>
<p>Although most interesting inputs are automatically synced to the &ldquo;<a href="https://t.me/pseudoyulife">Yu&rsquo;s Life</a>&rdquo; Telegram channel, I still select some to list here, which feels more like a newsletter.</p>

<p>I spent most of this week at the company, so I was especially looking forward to the weekend.</p>
<p>On Saturday, I went to the National Centre for the Performing Arts with senior Bo Yi to listen to a Beethoven concert. Previously, I often went to the Philharmonic Light Music Orchestra in Sanlitun to listen to some small-scale themed performances, such as Hayao Miyazaki, La La Land, and Century Classics. The small space had a great atmosphere, but I also wanted to experience the grandeur of a symphony orchestra, and finally, my wish came true!</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/beethoven_symphony_concert_ticket.jpg" alt="beethoven_symphony_concert_ticket"></p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/beethoven_symphony_concert_live.jpg" alt="beethoven_symphony_concert_live"></p>
<p>Interestingly, after the concert, I bought a Mozart brooch (because he&rsquo;s cuter) and made the following playful comment.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/beethoven_symphony_concert_tweet.png" alt="beethoven_symphony_concert_tweet"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today&rsquo;s whimsical thought: &ldquo;Just after listening to a Beethoven concert, I turned around and bought a Mozart brooch. I wonder if he would be sad?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After posting this tweet, I coincidentally met a Twitter friend, <a href="https://twitter.com/Noy_eth">Noy</a>, who was also at the National Centre for the Performing Arts at the same time. I found out that he&rsquo;s also involved in web3 development and likes to watch plays and concerts on weekends. We arranged to meet, and we can go watch together in the future!</p>
<p>There was another small surprise when we were walking to our seats at the theater. We passed by a handsome foreign guy who said, &ldquo;I love his hair.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s always nice to receive kindness from strangers. Now with my blue long hair, I&rsquo;m becoming more and more anime-like, with a 300% turn-around rate.</p>

<p>In my work, I am primarily involved in the architectural design and implementation of cross-chain projects. As our company&rsquo;s existing solution is based on the Cosmos blockchain, I have spent over a year working on some underlying chain development modifications using the Cosmos SDK. This has given me some understanding of its technical implementation. However, due to the tight development schedule, I never had the opportunity to gain a systematic understanding of Cosmos&rsquo; architectural design and the Tendermint consensus mechanism.</p>
<p>After the project concluded, I finally found time to read &ldquo;Blockchain Architecture and Implementation: Cosmos Explained&rdquo;. This article represents my own understanding and summary of Cosmos and Tendermint.</p>
<h2 id="blockchain-technology-development">Blockchain Technology Development</h2>
<p>Before delving into the specifics of the Cosmos blockchain, let&rsquo;s first review the history of blockchain development and the current mainstream blockchain technologies in the industry.</p>
<h3 id="technical-limitations">Technical Limitations</h3>
<p>The blockchain has been developing for over a decade now, from the initial Bitcoin to the once-popular EOS, and then to Ethereum, which has gradually become mainstream. Each has its own characteristics but also its limitations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Building on Bitcoin or Ethereum requires relatively high technical expertise due to the need to implement p2p networks, cryptography, consensus algorithms, etc.</li>
<li>Underlying chains based on the PoW (Proof of Work) mechanism are increasingly consuming more computing power (and electricity), which is not friendly to resources and the environment.</li>
<li>As the number and scale of on-chain applications continue to increase, the performance bottlenecks of chains are becoming more apparent.</li>
<li>As business scenarios become more complex and demands increase, the consensus algorithms of chains also need to evolve according to specific scenarios.</li>
<li>The underlying architectures of different chains vary greatly, and different chains are isolated, making it difficult to communicate with each other. The implementation of cross-chain technology solutions is also a challenge.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="technological-advancements">Technological Advancements</h3>
<p>To address these issues, the industry has developed numerous technical solutions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Due to the massive resource consumption of PoW, many chains have adopted the PoS (Proof of Stake) mechanism, such as EOS&rsquo;s DPoS and Ethereum&rsquo;s recently upgraded PoS, which are becoming increasingly mature.</li>
<li>To overcome the limitations of underlying chains, the model has gradually evolved from building separate chains for single applications (like Bitcoin) to building ÐApps using smart contracts.</li>
<li>To address performance limitations, Bitcoin Cash adopted a solution to increase block capacity, EOS adopted a solution to improve TPS (claiming millions of TPS), while Ethereum uses sharding to process on-chain transactions in parallel.</li>
<li>In terms of cross-chain technology, hash locking has been applied in Bitcoin and Algorand projects. Besides this, there are also solutions like notaries and relay chains.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cosmos-blockchain-framework">Cosmos Blockchain Framework</h2>
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>Cosmos is an open-source blockchain infrastructure project developed by Tendermint Inc. Its goal is to solve various problems encountered in the development of blockchain technology, providing a high-performance, highly scalable, and easy-to-develop blockchain framework. Its open-source address is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos">GitHub - cosmos/cosmos: Internet of Blockchains</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Cosmos can be seen as a multi-chain network, aiming to realize the vision of an &ldquo;Internet of Blockchains&rdquo;, with Tendermint and Cosmos SDK being its technical means and implementation path.</p>
<p>To address resource consumption and transaction issues, Cosmos adopted a BFT (Byzantine Fault Tolerance) + PoS (Proof of Stake) approach. Meanwhile, to lower the threshold for blockchain construction and blockchain-based application development, Cosmos adopted a more general project construction method, making chain development based on Cosmos more modular and engineered. It mainly consists of three parts: Tendermint Core, IBC, and Cosmos SDK.</p>
<h3 id="cosmos-sdk-components">Cosmos SDK Components</h3>
<p>Although named &ldquo;SDK&rdquo;, which can easily lead to some misunderstandings that it&rsquo;s merely a library/component for interacting with the chain, Cosmos SDK can actually be considered a complete architecture. Developers can use it to quickly build their own blockchain, making it an important part of the Cosmos ecosystem. Its open-source address is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk">GitHub - cosmos/cosmos-sdk: A Framework for Building High Value Public Blockchains</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Cosmos SDK mainly implements some common modules in blockchain, such as account systems, transactions, on-chain governance, etc. Developers can conveniently build new functional modules based on it.</p>
<p>Its main modules are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Account and transaction-related modules
<ul>
<li>auth: System account management</li>
<li>bank: On-chain asset transfer</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Auxiliary function modules
<ul>
<li>genutil: Genesis block</li>
<li>supply: Total asset management</li>
<li>crisis: Invariant management for all modules</li>
<li>params: Parameter management for all modules</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On-chain governance module
<ul>
<li>gov: On-chain governance mechanism</li>
<li>upgrade: Chain upgrade</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>PoS modules
<ul>
<li>staking: On-chain asset staking</li>
<li>slashing: Punishing validators for passive malicious behavior</li>
<li>evidence: Punishing validators for active malicious behavior</li>
<li>mint: On-chain asset minting</li>
<li>distribution: Block reward management</li>
<li>IBC protocol module</li>
<li>ibc/core: Cross-chain communication functionality</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As we can see, the Cosmos SDK framework is highly modularized due to the Object-Capability Model security philosophy. Each module has its own storage space and only exposes necessary interfaces externally.</p>
<p>There is a specific Keeper role in Cosmos SDK, used to maintain and update states. Through this management method, modules hide specific implementation details from each other and only call each other through keepers. Moreover, each module&rsquo;s internal state is only updated by its keeper, effectively ensuring the consistency of on-chain states.</p>
<h3 id="tendermint-component">Tendermint Component</h3>
<p>Tendermint is the core component of Cosmos, a high-performance blockchain underlying consensus engine. Architecturally, it is mainly divided into three parts: peer-to-peer network communication layer, consensus protocol layer, and upper application layer, with the consensus protocol layer being its key part.</p>
<p>When reaching consensus, Tendermint does not care about the specific transaction details, but only packages transactions as bytes into blocks, and then reaches consensus through mechanisms between nodes. It requires the upper application state update to be a deterministic process, that is, starting from the same initial state, the transaction order is consistent across the network (i.e., all normal nodes will process a sequence of messages in the same order), and the state of the upper application should remain consistent across the network. The blockchain will include digital fingerprints of the upper application for verification.</p>
<p>Tendermint consensus can support second-level block production in blockchain networks with hundreds of nodes. It provides the feature of block-by-block finality, meaning that after a block is confirmed, it can guarantee that all previous blocks will not be modified, ensuring the security of the blockchain network.</p>
<p>After a block is submitted, the Tendermint consensus protocol layer interacts with the upper layer through ABCI (an interface abstracted for interaction between the application layer and the consensus layer) to complete transaction processing and return results. It divides the block execution process into multiple steps, and the upper application has the autonomy to define business interaction logic, developing and implementing through specific interfaces (such as implementing validator screening logic or reusing Tendermint Core&rsquo;s consensus protocol and peer-to-peer network communication to implement chain business requirements).</p>
<p>For a detailed understanding of the Tendermint consensus algorithm mechanism, you can read the following paper:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.04938.pdf">The latest gossip on BFT consensus - Tendermint</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Its unique mechanisms bring significant advantages in the blockchain consensus process.</p>
<p>Firstly, Tendermint originates from the PBFT SMR (State Machine Replication) algorithm but simplifies its mechanism. Its consensus is mainly based on blocks rather than user requests, and mechanically unifies PBFT&rsquo;s regular process and view-change process, making it easier to understand and implement.</p>
<p>It provides solid infrastructure and good user experience, being one of the earliest underlying technologies capable of supporting second-level block production in blockchain networks with hundreds of nodes. At the same time, it ensures that all previous blocks will not be modified through block-by-block finality, guaranteeing the security of the blockchain network.</p>
<p>Nodes communicate with each other through the Gossip protocol, not requiring full connectivity between nodes, but communicating through a gossip peer-to-peer network. This can effectively reduce the communication cost between nodes while also effectively improving the fault tolerance of the network.</p>
<p>The implementation details and mechanisms of the Tendermint algorithm will be explained specifically in later series of articles.</p>
<h3 id="ibc-protocol-component">IBC Protocol Component</h3>
<p>The IBC protocol is a special module in Cosmos SDK, mainly providing cross-chain capabilities between blockchains for Cosmos. Its main principle is to prove its own on-chain events to other chains through cryptographic technology. It can be understood that the cross-chain parties are light nodes (light clients) for each other, and the communication between the two chains is realized through relayers, thus achieving cross-chain communication/transactions.</p>
<p>This part involves many details and is closely related to cross-chain, so it will be explained in detail in a separate article.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This article is the first in the Cosmos and Tendermint consensus series, mainly introducing the technological development of blockchain, core components such as Tendermint and Cosmos SDK in the Cosmos blockchain framework, and providing an overview of the principles and mechanisms of the Tendermint consensus protocol. Due to space limitations, it mainly focuses on concept explanation and process overview, without involving specific technical implementation details and code explanation. These will be supplemented in subsequent series of articles on the Tendermint consensus algorithm/mechanism and Cosmos SDK code implementation.</p>

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>This is a record and reflection of my life from <code>2023-02-01</code> to <code>2023-02-06</code>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the first week back at work. Since I had been doing some work during the Spring Festival, I wasn&rsquo;t unaccustomed to the work rhythm. However, I often couldn&rsquo;t freely do my own things, which suddenly made me feel pressed for time.</p>
<p>I started revisiting Japanese and was surprised to find that I still remembered a lot. Over the weekend, I watched some new dramas and went to the cinema for the first time in a year. I received the long-awaited Steam Deck and spent some time configuring it. On Monday, I started trying to feed Nie Nie chicken wings (which are said to be good for her coat), and she seems to have a good appetite and isn&rsquo;t picky. After half a year, I reorganized the kitchen and started cooking for myself, which has lasted for three days now. On Monday, I went out to eat the Okonomiyaki I had been craving. There were many other interesting things as well.</p>
<h2 id="japanese-learning">Japanese Learning</h2>
<p>Because I plan to go to Japan, I set a flag at the beginning of the year to revisit Japanese. The last time I studied was probably six or seven years ago. Fortunately, I haven&rsquo;t forgotten the fifty sounds and some basic grammar, so it didn&rsquo;t take too long to pick up. However, because I now have the pressure of taking a certification exam, I&rsquo;ve started studying seriously again.</p>
<h3 id="course-resources">Course Resources</h3>
<p>Previously, I had been watching Mr. Ye&rsquo;s New Standard Japanese Elementary course on Hujiang Online School, which is a relatively classic textbook. There are official recorded courses on Bilibili:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1es41127PE/">【Japanese Course】Standard Japanese Elementary Intensive Lecture BY Adorable Mr. Ye</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Recently, I saw a Japanese learning <a href="https://twitter.com/yellow532486/status/1619895028201189377">thread</a> by a blogger named <a href="https://twitter.com/yellow532486">Yellow</a> on Twitter. They use &ldquo;Minna no Nihongo&rdquo; and also mentioned a companion YouTube tutorial by a Japanese teacher in Taiwan. It seems interesting, and I want to try it:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@deguchi">Deguchi Japanese - YouTube</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="supplementary-materials">Supplementary Materials</h3>
<p>Regarding vocabulary and grammar learning, I recalled listening to a podcast channel every day on my way to class when I was a freshman to memorize some grammar points. It was very effective (<del>mainly because the voice was so pleasant to listen to</del>):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/cn/podcast/myrcella%E7%9A%84%E6%97%A5%E8%AF%AD%E8%A7%92/id875790959">《Myrcella&rsquo;s Japanese Corner》- Apple Podcasts</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Because I&rsquo;m accustomed to the learning mode of books + courses, I didn&rsquo;t look for other auxiliary resources in the early stages. I plan to focus on laying a solid foundation first.</p>
<h3 id="input-method">Input Method</h3>
<p>After solving the learning material problem, the next issue was the input method. For iOS, I use the native input method, without any modifications.</p>
<p>For my daily macOS use, because I need double pinyin, I use the <a href="https://rime.im/">Rime Input Method</a>, and I&rsquo;ve configured it to remove the system&rsquo;s native ABC input method following this article:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ssnhd.com/2022/01/01/mac-inputdel/">Mac Delete Native English ABC</a></li>
</ul>
<p>So I didn&rsquo;t want to add a new system native input method for Japanese. Instead, I found a Japanese tuning scheme suitable for Rime, which has been great so far:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/gkovacs/rime-japanese">GitHub - gkovacs/rime-japanese: Japanese Input Method</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The usage effect is as follows:</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/japanese_rime_input.png" alt="japanese_rime_input"></p>
<p>However, there&rsquo;s a problem: after using double pinyin for a long time, sometimes when typing in romaji, I unconsciously type in double pinyin. I&rsquo;m still struggling to adapt&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="interesting-things-and-objects">Interesting Things and Objects</h2>
<h3 id="steam-deck">Steam Deck</h3>
<p>The happiest thing this week was receiving the Steam Deck sent by my dear friend. Although it had actually arrived in December, shipping to Hong Kong wasn&rsquo;t convenient, so I didn&rsquo;t get my hands on it until after the New Year. It&rsquo;s much bigger than I imagined, but not heavy, and the feel is super comfortable.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/yu_steam_deck_1.jpg" alt="yu_steam_deck_1"></p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/yu_steam_deck_2.jpg" alt="yu_steam_deck_2"></p>
<p>Although I&rsquo;ve bought many Switch games like a squirrel, I actually rarely play them. I&rsquo;ve always found it difficult to truly relax through gaming as a form of entertainment. Ni has been urging me to play games for so many years, but to little effect. After switching to Mac, I even rarely opened Steam. This time, I finally have no excuse about not having the right device, haha. I plan to regularly experience some classic games in the future.</p>
<p>By the way, the exclusive skin that came with the Steam Deck is really cool.</p>

<p>Because I had less commute time this week, I didn&rsquo;t listen to many podcasts. The one that left a deep impression was:</p>

</ul>
<h4 id="books">Books</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World</strong>, currently reading. It&rsquo;s been a long time since I&rsquo;ve felt such anticipation from a novel. Perhaps it&rsquo;s because of the narrative style, or because I read a few short chapters each time during my journeys, which creates some discontinuity. I always want to know what will happen next, but I don&rsquo;t want to rush through and miss such beautiful writing. Also, the setting of &ldquo;another space&rdquo; reminds me of an old but equally interesting game, &ldquo;Waste City Story&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="tv-series">TV Series</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Last of Us</strong>, I had heard about the game before, and recently a TV series was released. I watched the first two episodes, and it&rsquo;s not bad. I&rsquo;ll continue to follow it.</li>
<li><strong>The Three-Body Problem</strong>, I started watching this series because I was disappointed with the animation. Surprisingly, it&rsquo;s quite good. I really like Yu Hewei. The pace of the series is a bit slow, and sometimes it&rsquo;s a bit hard to watch the Three-Body game parts, but overall it&rsquo;s worth following. I&rsquo;m also looking forward to the Netflix version.</li>
<li><strong>The Knockout</strong>, It seems that apart from the Fog Theater, I haven&rsquo;t followed many new dramas of this genre in recent years. But because of the many discussions, I took a look and was quite pleasantly surprised. Even though there are inevitably some politically correct compromises, it&rsquo;s still quite bold. Even the minor characters are well-developed, but the ending was a bit abstract. In this genre, I would still recommend &ldquo;The Silent Truth&rdquo; more.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="movies">Movies</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deep Sea</strong>, I had heard some not-so-good reviews, but maybe because it was the first movie I&rsquo;ve seen in a theater in over half a year, there was some emotional bonus, and I thought it was quite good. A little girl&rsquo;s dream, a Spirited Away-like fairy tale world, slightly exaggerated performances, and fairly appropriate BGM (except for the &ldquo;Little White Boat&rdquo; which suddenly took me out of the movie to &ldquo;The Bad Kids&rdquo;). At least we can see that Chinese animated films are trying to explore smaller and more delicate perspectives to present, rather than just various myths and legends.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="personal-life-snapshots">Personal Life Snapshots</h2>
<h3 id="life">Life</h3>
<p>This week felt like it passed magically. After the New Year, I took three days off. On the first day back at work, I came home early because I was worried about Nie Nie and bought a mobile camera. On the third day, I went home early because there was a fire in the building below our company. On the fourth day, because the project manager and tester went skiing and hot spring bathing together, I also worked from home. All in all, I only worked two days in the office, but I still completed my work.</p>
<p>Although there were no casualties in the fire, it&rsquo;s still quite scary that it happened in the city center. However, at times like this, I found that everyone around me, from family to friends, has a bit of a comedian in them.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/thursday_fire_tweet.png" alt="thursday_fire_tweet"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our company building caught fire🔥 at noon, there was smoke everywhere, and nine fire trucks came.</p>
<p>Project manager sister: I risked my life to bring your computer down (remember to work overtime when you get back).
My family: It&rsquo;s good that the computer was brought down.</p>
<p>Is the computer my true self? 🙃</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the weekend, I had planned quite a bit of work, but because I was watching &ldquo;The Knockout&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Three-Body Problem&rdquo;, my efficiency was high but the completion amount was not enough. I&rsquo;ll have to make up for a lot this week.</p>
<p>On Sunday night, because a friend happened to be watching a movie near my house, they invited me to go together. We didn&rsquo;t choose the more popular &ldquo;The Wandering Earth 2&rdquo; or &ldquo;Full River Red&rdquo;, but watched &ldquo;Deep Sea&rdquo;. It wasn&rsquo;t until I entered the cinema that I realized it had been a long time since I had watched a movie offline. There is indeed some emotional bonus, and I will try to go watch more movies by myself in the future.</p>
<p>On Monday night, I went to eat the Okonomiyaki that I had been craving for several months.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/screenshot_from_silent.jpg" alt="screenshot_from_silent"></p>
<p>Actually, the reason was that when watching &ldquo;Silent Snow&rdquo;, I saw that they just love to eat various things, especially teppanyaki Okonomiyaki, which looks very appetizing. I had complained to a friend before:</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/some_thoughts_about_silent.png" alt="some_thoughts_about_silent"></p>
<p>But because of my chosen worker physique, I hadn&rsquo;t caught COVID yet (until now), and I was afraid to go out before the New Year. Now I&rsquo;ve become more relaxed and am eating, drinking, and having fun everywhere.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/beer_and_monday.png" alt="beer_and_monday"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Eh, Okonomiyaki?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finally ate the Okonomiyaki that I had been craving for a long time because of a scene in a Japanese drama. Indeed, a worker&rsquo;s Monday and draft beer are a perfect match!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks to senior Boyi for being my regular dining companion, saving me from the miserable moment of drinking two glasses of draft beer alone. My happy playtime in Beijing has increased again.</p>

<p>Because I couldn&rsquo;t find Nie Nie in the camera and was worried, I later bought a mobile monitoring robot. While debugging, I accidentally took several photos that I think are so cute. With the camera later, I felt much more at ease.</p>

<p>This week, I had an interesting topic discussion with a friend. I was asked what personality I think Nie Nie has, a question I had never thought about but found very interesting.</p>

<p>This is quite an interesting proposition because cats can&rsquo;t take the test themselves, and the personality we see in them is often shaped by our observations from daily interactions and our own wishful thinking. To some extent, it&rsquo;s also a projection of our various concepts. It&rsquo;s a novel perspective. Actually, it&rsquo;s been a long time since I&rsquo;ve had such a comfortable and interesting conversation with friends, and I cherish it.</p>

<p>This is a record and reflection of my life from <code>2023-01-23</code> to <code>2023-01-31</code>.</p>
<p>I spent most of this week in my hometown, making up for some regrets, simple yet precious. After returning to Hangzhou, I stayed an extra day to meet friends, then hurried back to Beijing from Hangzhou. Upon arriving home in Beijing, I immediately went to pick up Nini from my colleague&rsquo;s house after barely putting down my luggage. By the time everything was more or less settled, I was in a daze. After a quick wash, I planned to take a short nap and write a weekly review, but when I opened my eyes again, it was already 7 am. Plus, I had to commute to the office during the day, so I postponed writing until now.</p>
<p>On my first day back, Nini immediately irritated me, adding some fright to my first day at work, but thinking about returning to this interesting daily life made me feel more at ease than reproachful (<del>as if I dare</del>). Then I quickly ordered a mobile camera, no wonder friends say I&rsquo;m raising Nini like a daughter, always worrying about various things. There were many other interesting events as well.</p>

<h3 id="mastodon">Mastodon</h3>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t write many blog posts this week, and I didn&rsquo;t finish several things I wanted to tinker with before the New Year, but I did research fediverse, which I found very interesting.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/elk_zone_mastodon_yu.png" alt="elk_zone_mastodon_yu"></p>
<p>I originally thought about posting some English content on Mastodon, but later decided to narrow my output platforms. I&rsquo;ll still post on Twitter and automatically sync to Mastodon via IFTTT, still aggregating on the Telegram channel and Crossbell chain. If you&rsquo;re interested, you can join me at <a href="https://mas.to/@pseudoyu">@pseudoyu@mas.to</a> on the <a href="https://mas.to/">mas.to</a> domain.</p>
<p>There are several interesting articles about these topics that I read and learned a lot from:</p>

<p>Additionally, in the previous article <a href="https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2023/01/09/weekly_review_20230109/">&ldquo;Weekly Review #25 - Personal Information Output and Synchronization System Based on Crossbell (Refactoring)&rdquo;</a>, I mentioned issues with syncing Twitter and Telegram historical messages to the chain. Subsequently, I received corresponding solutions from them:</p>

</ul>
<p>While using it, I also reported a few bugs. After experiencing it more deeply, I&rsquo;ll organize and write a detailed article, as well as raise some issues. It&rsquo;s quite interesting.</p>
<h3 id="input">Input</h3>
<h4 id="books">Books</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>What I Talk About When I Talk About Running</strong>, Murakami&rsquo;s essays or collections are actually quite easy to read. His words carry some sharpness but also convey sincerity and a unique flavor, like a conversation, yet often buried within is a seemingly deliberate humor that makes one smile involuntarily. It took about three months to truly finish reading, as one of the few physical books at hand, it was more often picked up and flipped through when remembered. The first time I went to the cat shelter, although I was moved, I hadn&rsquo;t really made up my mind to take on such responsibility so quickly. But on the way, I casually flipped to a page that read, &ldquo;At that time, we were living a very frugal, Spartan lifestyle. We had neither a TV nor a radio at home, not even an alarm clock. There was hardly any heating equipment, so on cold nights, we had to sleep tightly hugging the few cats we kept at home. The cats also tried hard to cuddle up to us.&rdquo; These few short sentences became the biggest motivation for me to bring a cat home at that moment. It also talks about many things, about hobbies, the purpose of writing, creative ideas and balance, all of which I&rsquo;ve only begun to understand a little after slowly settling down over the past two months.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World</strong>, it&rsquo;s been a long time since I&rsquo;ve felt such anticipation from a novel. Perhaps it&rsquo;s because of the narrative style, or because I read a few short chapters each time during journeys, making it somewhat discontinuous. I always want to know what will happen next, but I don&rsquo;t want to rush through and miss such beautiful writing. Also, this setting of &ldquo;another space&rdquo; reminds me of an old but equally interesting game called &ldquo;Phantom City&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="tv-series">TV Series</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Silent Snow</strong>, I really liked the first few episodes, with Spitz&rsquo;s songs, the personalities of each character, and the comfortable daily life. Perhaps because I empathized too much with the emotions of the second male lead, Sodo, a kind of gentleness and determination described by Iwai Shunji as &ldquo;I love you, and it has nothing to do with you&rdquo;. Later, I became increasingly disappointed with the development of the plot, and even at the end, I couldn&rsquo;t really understand the basis of Aoba and Omoi&rsquo;s feelings. It was indeed beautiful, but somewhat straightforward and thin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Three-Body Problem TV Series</strong>, it has become a series that I continue to watch every day. The plot pace is a bit slow, but from what I&rsquo;ve seen so far, I still have some expectations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="anime">Anime</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bungo Stray Dogs</strong>, I&rsquo;ve been slowly catching up during the New Year. I find the setting of using writers and literary works as tasks and skills quite interesting, and I like the personality designs of many characters in the Detective Agency. However, I don&rsquo;t feel like I&rsquo;ll immediately want to watch the next season. Maybe I&rsquo;ll continue watching when I think of it later.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="personal-life-snapshots">Personal Life Snapshots</h2>
<h3 id="life">Life</h3>
<p>Following up on the description of home in last week&rsquo;s review, I spent nearly 10 days at my hometown this New Year, which is rare in recent years. There are fewer and fewer people in the hometown, and the whole atmosphere seems cold and less lively, but we can set off real fireworks, which is also a kind of special memory.</p>
<p>Because I left when I was young, even the memories of childhood playmates have long been blurred, let alone any childhood friends. So in these ten days, I visited my grandmother, accompanied my grandparents and other family members, which was indeed a rare leisure time.</p>
<p>There was plenty of warmth, but the daily sub-zero temperatures made me can&rsquo;t help but miss the times with heating and Nini (<del>gradually losing the backbone of a southerner and surrendering to central heating, it&rsquo;s too comfortable</del>). But it&rsquo;s okay, I brought the old Intel MBP, which heats up just by running an IDE plus a few web pages.</p>
<p>I brought a camera this year, although I didn&rsquo;t take it out to shoot much because of cold hands, I did take many family photos. The elderly don&rsquo;t really like taking photos, but fortunately, we now have tools like smartphones that can record daily life at any time, so there&rsquo;s not too much regret. But I still miss the times when the whole family went to the photo studio, although it&rsquo;s already a memory from many years ago. This time I acted as the photographer, taking many photos for the whole family and each small family. Sony&rsquo;s autofocus and continuous shooting are really praiseworthy.</p>
<p>When it came to my family&rsquo;s turn, my sister brought a dog as a &ldquo;placeholder&rdquo;, saying I could photoshop myself in later. She has a bit of a comedian in her who only teases her brother. In the end, we did take a photo with the dog, four of us neatly arranged, without me, haha. I guess this is one of those &ldquo;sounds ridiculous, but in my family, it seems quite normal&rdquo; interesting things.</p>
<p>Of course, for the big family photo, we used a tripod and timed continuous shooting. I plan to edit and print some photos recently.</p>
<h3 id="nini">Nini</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/nie_nie_on_the_bed.jpg" alt="nie_nie_on_the_bed"></p>
<p>This time I left Nini for nearly half a month. Although my colleague was very attentive and often sent me videos, I was still not completely at ease. The first thing I did after returning to Beijing was to go to my colleague&rsquo;s house. On the way back, I was constantly comforting her, fortunately, she hadn&rsquo;t forgotten me, still had some conscience. After returning home, there wasn&rsquo;t much sense of unfamiliarity, she immediately went to lie comfortably in her favorite corner, which is good.</p>
<p>The next day, because I had some things to discuss with the project team, plus I hadn&rsquo;t been there for a long time, I tidied up and went to the company. I felt that after getting used to remote work, going back to the office to work was a bit uncomfortable. I felt like I arrived at the company at 10:30, exchanged greetings with colleagues I hadn&rsquo;t seen for a long time, just opened my computer for a while and was called to lunch, after eating it was time for a nap. I feel that when time is deliberately divided into &ldquo;work and rest&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s easier to disrupt the rhythm. I might still prefer the mode of finishing work without eating or drinking, and then arranging my own things with the remaining time.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also another thing that&rsquo;s both annoying and funny.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/dispear_nie_nie.png" alt="dispear_nie_nie"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Going to the office for the first time in three months, I opened the camera during the lunch break and experienced ten minutes of not seeing the cat, turning on the microphone and calling for five minutes with no response, carefully recalling whether I had closed my doors and windows properly, extremely irritated and anxious, quickly asking for leave, rushing home all the way, and finally arriving home to find her hiding in the blind spot behind the chair, too lazy to poke her head out. I guess the number one reason I want to switch to a fully remote job next time is probably this troublesome Nini 🙃.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a follow-up.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/dispear_nie_nie_2.png" alt="dispear_nie_nie_2"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Following up on the previous post. After coming back, I originally wanted to educate her properly, but she quickly jumped up and fell asleep on my legs. When she woke up, she had a confused look, so innocent that I couldn&rsquo;t bear to scold her. So I gave her the cold shoulder for an hour and let it go. Also, I ordered the ebo mobile camera recommended by <a href="https://twitter.com/mr_easonyang">@mr_easonyang</a>, thanks! I&rsquo;ll be more at ease when going out in the future!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><del>In the future, I can control the surveillance robot to tease the cat when slacking off.</del></p>
<h3 id="others">Others</h3>
<p>Two close friends have some conflicts that are difficult to reconcile at this stage. As a small group of three people who have been like family for many years, I can&rsquo;t help but feel a bit guilty about whether I&rsquo;ve done too little in this situation.</p>
<p>I hope everything will be alright.</p>

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>This is a record and reflection of my life from <code>2023-01-16</code> to <code>2023-01-22</code>.</p>
<p>This week, my time was equally divided between Beijing, Hangzhou, and my hometown in Jiangsu, traveling back and forth. For someone who hasn&rsquo;t left home for almost three months, the journey brought some fatigue, but I found that I&rsquo;m not actually averse to such a long-standing change in my life rhythm, and even feel some novelty and anticipation.</p>
<p>I sent Nini to a colleague&rsquo;s house for fostering, which worried me; returned to Hangzhou, accompanied my parents and sister, met some friends; then hurriedly returned to my hometown in Jiangsu for the Spring Festival. Perhaps due to an improvement in my mental state, I&rsquo;ve become more positive about the New Year and Spring Festival this year, sent some New Year&rsquo;s greetings to friends, and regained some sense of ritual. I also discovered that my friends have quite interesting ways of speaking, and I&rsquo;ve been posting more of these daily occurrences on Twitter recently, which is probably the recovery of the desire to share that I mentioned before. There were many other interesting things as well.</p>
<h2 id="what-makes-a-home">What Makes a Home</h2>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/sunset_and_trees_in_jiangsu.jpg" alt="sunset_and_trees_in_jiangsu"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A sunset I accidentally captured on my first day back home. After taking it, I felt that the sky over the fields has a unique feeling. This scene reminds me a bit of the cover image of &ldquo;Flipped&rdquo;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When it comes to going home or returning to one&rsquo;s hometown, there are always complex emotions involved. Or to put it more abstractly, I&rsquo;ve gone through a lot of thinking and changes regarding the sense of belonging to &ldquo;home&rdquo; and &ldquo;family&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Although I was born in Hangzhou, I spent most of my childhood in my hometown in Jiangsu. My parents were developing their careers in Hangzhou, which was probably a reasonable choice for young people of that era. In my somewhat faded childhood memories, the image of my parents is not very clear. It wasn&rsquo;t until I was in second grade, at the age of 9, that I came to live with my parents in Hangzhou.</p>
<p>Perhaps due to the influence of some sense of closeness, I&rsquo;ve always lived quite independently. From around junior high school, whether it was choosing middle school entrance exam preferences, high school independent recruitment, college entrance exam preferences, city choices at these important decision points, or daily trivial matters, it seemed that I always had to make decisions independently. My parents rarely gave me advice, let alone make decisions for me. Of course, the advantage was that they also wouldn&rsquo;t interfere with things like my grades or puppy love (<del>they even covered for me</del>).</p>
<p>The clearest memory I have is from my senior year of high school. My grades ranking just qualified me for the opportunity of independent recruitment to &ldquo;Southern University of Science and Technology&rdquo;, an interesting school that had just been established at that time. I was quite tempted, but for someone who had rarely left Jiangsu and Zhejiang at that time, it was difficult to make a decisive decision to go to such an unfamiliar city for an interview under the considerable pressure of senior year coursework. So I still dialed my dad&rsquo;s number, briefly stated the situation to him, wanting to ask for his advice. The response I got was just a &ldquo;You decide for yourself&rdquo;, then he hung up.</p>
<p>It would be a lie to say there wasn&rsquo;t a hint of sadness and resentment, especially seeing classmates around the phone booth enthusiastically discussing and weighing the opportunities of several candidate schools with their parents. I seemed to feel so helpless for the first time. After returning to the candidate classroom, I didn&rsquo;t say another word and signed to give up all opportunities.</p>
<p>It was the same with the college entrance exam preferences after the exam. At that time, I avoided all options in Zhejiang and Shanghai due to some emotional issues, probably only spent two or three hours in the afternoon choosing several out-of-province schools I had never known about but had scores that roughly matched from that pink book of previous years&rsquo; admissions handbook. My parents knew the reason but also didn&rsquo;t intervene much. Maybe there was still some element of spite, I was quite immature at that time.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until my junior year of college, when I was busy with entrepreneurship and some internship travel, that I happened to be on a business trip to Hangzhou and rushed home to stay for one night. It was almost one o&rsquo;clock, and when I got home, I found my mom still waiting for me, while my dad had just gotten drunk from some social engagements and went to bed first. At that time, for some reason, sitting on the edge of the bed, I started talking with my mom about various things from the past, and only then did I realize that I had never really tried to understand my parents&rsquo; inner thoughts or tried to communicate.</p>
<p>My parents are both born after 1975, which is considered quite young compared to the parents of my peers. Mom said it was their first time being parents, and they had no experience. They felt guilty for not being able to accompany me through my childhood due to their work. When I came to Hangzhou, they were also at a loss as to how to face this familiar yet somewhat strange individual. In the end, they chose &ldquo;respect&rdquo;, and also talked about many details of our interactions over the years.</p>
<p>To be honest, when I first heard this, I was a bit surprised. I had made many self-centered guesses before, always feeling that perhaps because I didn&rsquo;t grow up by their side from a young age, the feelings weren&rsquo;t as deep, and thus seemed to lack some of the emotional bonds between parents and children, which might be difficult to make up for.</p>
<p>I also had some realizations. In fact, my parents have given me a lot imperceptibly. In the dozen or so years since I can remember, I have never seen my parents argue, and even now their love has not diminished with the years, leaving me with many beautiful fantasies about family. My father is very tolerant, he has never beaten or scolded me from childhood to adulthood, but he is particularly strict about time consciousness and promises. When I violate these, he always repeatedly emphasizes them until they become ingrained in me. Although my mother leaves most decisions to my father, her kindness and gentleness in character have greatly influenced me, making me at least prioritize good and evil when facing various choices, and treat others with sincerity. As for the aspect I used to resent about always having to make decisions independently, it actually allowed me to move forward firmly on my own in many life choices after my junior and senior years of college. It can be said that my later entrepreneurship, cross-major application, going to Hong Kong for graduate studies, coming to Beijing to work, and various decisions that might be called brave that I will make later, all stem from this.</p>
<p>After this long talk, it seems I&rsquo;ve gotten used to this way of interacting. Every time I go home, we always chat until late at night, whether about my experiences in various places or family matters, interacting like friends, and even teasing each other (<del>for example, my mom always thinks I&rsquo;m a playboy</del>). I still wander in various cities living my own life as an individual, but home is no longer just a temporary resting place for me, but has become a kind of belonging to rely on, independent yet not estranged.</p>
<p>As for my hometown, it can be said that I was fortunate. Until early 2021, in the more than twenty years I had lived, I had not experienced any heart-wrenching farewells, and therefore thought this was a very natural thing. It wasn&rsquo;t until I received a short but painful four words from my father one morning saying &ldquo;Grandmother has passed away&rdquo; that I truly felt a sense of spiritual and emotional tearing.</p>
<p>At that time, because I was studying for my master&rsquo;s degree in Hong Kong, I couldn&rsquo;t make it for the last farewell, and for the following year, I couldn&rsquo;t return for various reasons. As it dragged on, it&rsquo;s already been three years. As I got closer to going home, I felt more guilty and afraid. Having grown up by my grandmother&rsquo;s side since childhood, my emotions need no elaboration, but it&rsquo;s even harder to imagine the pain in my mother&rsquo;s heart. Returning to my hometown thus took on a different meaning.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/yu_tweet_about_camera.png" alt="yu_tweet_about_camera"></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a movie called &ldquo;Capernaum&rdquo;, the story itself doesn&rsquo;t have much in common, but I was quite impressed by this title. Everyone&rsquo;s home is different, but we always need to keep searching for such an existence, whether it&rsquo;s called origin or belonging.</p>
<h2 id="personal-life-snippets">Personal Life Snippets</h2>
<h3 id="ninis-recent-situation">Nini&rsquo;s Recent Situation</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/leave_my_cute_cat_nienie.jpg" alt="leave_my_cute_cat_nienie"></p>
<p>Nini is being fostered at the home of the small leader of my project. He was very thoughtful and drove over to pick her up on the 17th. I packed so many things, gave all sorts of instructions, completely reluctant to part, even though it&rsquo;s just a short separation. However, she seems to be adapting quite well. Although she&rsquo;s not very active during the day, she still comes out to explore at night, and her diet is normal, which has somewhat put my mind at ease.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s completely an old father&rsquo;s mentality. I&rsquo;m worried that she might suffer if she doesn&rsquo;t adapt well, but also feel a bit lost if she adapts too well (<del>she won&rsquo;t be that heartless, right?</del>). My friends say I&rsquo;d better not raise a daughter in the future, I&rsquo;d worry myself to death.</p>
<p>But it seems she&rsquo;s taken a liking to the bird they keep in a cage at their house. He always thinks Nini wants to eat her, I spent a long time explaining that Nini is so cute and friendly, she probably just likes her and wants to play with her, <del>I don&rsquo;t know if he believed me</del>.</p>
<p>I want to go back and pick her up.</p>
<h3 id="meeting-friends">Meeting Friends</h3>
<p>On the first day back in Hangzhou, I met with a junior who&rsquo;s doing a side project with me. We met around June or July because I posted my weekly review on Jike, and after chatting a bit, we surprisingly found out he&rsquo;s a junior from my undergraduate university. I have to say the world is quite small. Later we talked about a lot of ideas, and he also deeply participated in a startup project as the main programmer. Actually, although I had some shallow experience in various positions before and had done some entrepreneurship, I was really tired of those tedious parts. He happens to be very good at these things, allowing me to focus only on the engineering implementation. Also, the earliest idea of the project came from some of my personal information management needs, which is a kind of unexpected fit. We finally met offline this time, exchanged some ideas, and have quite a few tasks and arrangements for the New Year, but we managed to slack off on New Year&rsquo;s Eve and the first day of the New Year (<del>mainly because it was too cold</del>).</p>
<p>I finally met <a href="https://twitter.com/strrlthedev">STRRL</a>. When I first started playing with Twitter, I was just a small nobody. I met STRRL through exchanging blog links, and he brought me into a weekly review group created by <a href="https://twitter.com/RealAkemiHomura">Homura</a>, where I had more interactions with everyone, gradually becoming an outlet for my desire to express.</p>
<p>As a deeply socially anxious person, although I had (and only had) the experience of meeting Homura face-to-face in Beijing before, I was still somewhat afraid before meeting. We arranged to have lunch at a small commercial area in Hangzhou. After meeting, I found him to be very cool and interesting. We talked about a lot of interesting experiences from before and some plans, without feeling too restrained. On the contrary, we found quite a few common points. It was a very successful face-to-face exchange! (<del>I feel like I actually talk quite a lot when I really meet people</del>)</p>
<h3 id="input">Input</h3>
<h4 id="books">Books</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>What I Talk About When I Talk About Running</strong>, still reading, but progress is slow.</li>
<li><strong>Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World</strong>, reading on the high-speed train on the way back. Haven&rsquo;t read many chapters, but I&rsquo;m attracted by this kind of interwoven narrative method and many of its descriptive methods. I&rsquo;ll finish it in the next few days.</li>
<li><strong>Outrageous Acts and Everyday Rebellions</strong>, I actually rarely read books directly related to feminism. Somerset Maugham&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Painted Veil&rdquo; is probably the most related one in my impression. This book was strongly recommended by a friend, and it&rsquo;s in the form of letters. I read the beginning and found it quite good, so I&rsquo;m reading it in parallel.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="anime">Anime</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bungo Stray Dogs</strong>, following the series. I find the setting of using writers and literary works as tasks and skills quite interesting. I watch a few episodes at night.</li>
<li><strong>The Three-Body Problem Animated Version</strong>, I&rsquo;m really watching the animated version casually.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="tv-series">TV Series</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Three-Body Problem</strong>, the TV series version actually feels quite good. Maybe it&rsquo;s mainly because I quite like Yu Hewei (I was deeply impressed by his portrayal of Chen Duxiu in &ldquo;The Age of Awakening&rdquo;), so I watch the updates in my spare time at night. But the pace is too slow. I hope it can at least maintain a stable performance, and not become incomprehensible like the animated version.</li>

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>This is a record and reflection of my life from January 10, 2023 to January 15, 2023.</p>
<p>The holiday season is approaching, though I don&rsquo;t have much of a sense of ritual for the New Year. Last year, I spent over a week playing through &ldquo;Pokémon Legends: Arceus&rdquo; and revisiting &ldquo;Fire Emblem: Three Houses&rdquo;. On New Year&rsquo;s Day, I made hot pot and had a video call with my family, and just like that, the year passed. However, since I&rsquo;ve decided to go home this year, with arrangements for fostering Nini and various plans for the New Year, I haven&rsquo;t been able to relax much. I&rsquo;m trying to finish many things in advance to free up some time to spend with my family.</p>
<p>Work-wise, I&rsquo;ve had an average week. The recently launched requirements had a few minor issues in the details, forcing my leader and me to work overtime to address them. There&rsquo;s also a new feature that needs to be launched before the New Year, but testing isn&rsquo;t complete yet, with only two or three days left. The project I&rsquo;m working on with friends has also encountered some problems. The friend originally responsible for the frontend had to leave, so I had to take over his part. The launch will be delayed, and I won&rsquo;t be able to truly relax during the New Year. It&rsquo;s quite an adjustment.</p>
<p>Because Nini will be fostered at a colleague&rsquo;s house, I took her to the vet for a check-up today, just to be safe, and also had her nails trimmed. The doctor said she&rsquo;s very healthy, and the previous minor ailments have basically recovered. He also praised me for taking good care of her, which made me happy. However, thinking about the fostering still makes me reluctant and worried. I&rsquo;ll come back early after the New Year, after all, now that I have something to be concerned about.</p>
<p>I accepted a rather intriguing interview, received an incredibly cute keyboard, continued to optimize my blog a bit (<del>just optimizing the theme instead of writing articles</del>), and many other interesting things happened.</p>
<h2 id="interesting-things-and-objects">Interesting Things and Objects</h2>
<h3 id="blog-tinkering">Blog Tinkering</h3>
<p>My current version of my personal blog has been running for nearly three years now. Previously, I had used solutions like setting up WordPress on my own server, but later, due to lack of stability and difficulties in data migration, I switched to the once-and-for-all solution of Hugo static blog + GitHub automatic deployment + Cloudflare hosting. For details, you can check out &ldquo;<a href="https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2022/06/12/why_i_still_write_blog_in_2022/">Why I&rsquo;m Still Blogging in 2022</a>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<a href="https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2022/05/29/deploy_your_blog_using_hugo_and_github_action/">Deploy Your Blog Using Hugo and GitHub Action</a>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The reason I chose Hugo, apart from the somewhat inexplicable but not particularly useful sense of familiarity due to my main job being Go development, is primarily because of the theme I&rsquo;m currently using, &ldquo;<a href="https://github.com/shaform/hugo-theme-den">den</a>&rdquo;. This is a theme written by a Taiwanese developer himself. At the time, he was considering switching from <a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican">Pelican</a> to <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> due to factors like build speed, but he liked his original theme, so he recreated it himself. You can read more about it in his post &ldquo;<a href="https://city.shaform.com/zh/2018/07/22/migrate-from-pelican-and-wordpress-to-hugo/">Migrating from Pelican and WordPress to Hugo</a>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I started following his blog for tech and personal thoughts output around 2018, and I can say that to a large extent, my later article style and thought patterns were greatly influenced by him. This theme, which carries a bit of the old internet style, perfectly matched my aesthetics, so after some tinkering, I set it up and have been using it until now.</p>
<p>Since it&rsquo;s primarily for personal use, although this theme is very aesthetically pleasing and minimalist, there are still some missing features. So over the three years of use, I&rsquo;ve been constantly patching and modifying it according to my own needs. Last year, I also submitted PRs for my modifications to RSS Feeds, related articles, and friend links. Some of them were merged into the main branch after some communication, while a few are still pending (<del>too lazy</del>).</p>
<p>Recently, I discovered the <a href="https://pagefind.app/">Pagefind</a> web search solution on <a href="https://twitter.com/WuPingJu">P.J. Wu&rsquo;s</a> blog. After some research, I integrated it into my blog, and the effect is quite good.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/pagefind_and_hugo_2.png" alt="pagefind_and_hugo_2"></p>
<p>It adopts the approach of pre-generating article index files instead of real-time retrieval, which makes it very fast and doesn&rsquo;t require additional backend services, making it very suitable for static blog deployment solutions. For an introduction to Pagefind and its usage, you can check out <a href="https://twitter.com/WuPingJu">P.J. Wu&rsquo;s</a> article &ldquo;<a href="https://pinchlime.com/blog/how-to-add-a-search-function-to-zola-generated-static-websites-via-pagefind/">How to Add a Search Function to Zola-generated Static Websites via Pagefind</a>&rdquo;, although it&rsquo;s about integrating into the Zola blog framework and publishing through Netlify, the principle is similar. As for the integration method for Hugo, I&rsquo;ll write an article after I&rsquo;ve tinkered with the configuration. You can preview it at <a href="https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/search">this address</a>, or click on &ldquo;Search&rdquo; in the navigation bar (I&rsquo;ve added a back-to-top function, you can click to return directly).</p>
<p>I integrated it into my original GitHub CI automatic publishing workflow, and the experience is seamless. I also integrated a search page UI through Hugo&rsquo;s shortcode method for use, which is very powerful. I&rsquo;ll also submit a PR to the theme repository to support this, to see if there&rsquo;s any demand in this area.</p>
<p>However, after using it, I found some issues with Chinese support. It can&rsquo;t segment words very well. For example, searching for &ldquo;区块链&rdquo; (blockchain) directly won&rsquo;t match, but changing it to &ldquo;区块 链&rdquo; (block chain), manually segmenting the words, will give the desired effect. I&rsquo;ve noted the search method on the page, <del>it&rsquo;s not unusable after all</del>. We&rsquo;ll see if there are better solutions in the future.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/pagefind_and_hugo_1.png" alt="pagefind_and_hugo_1"></p>
<p>Interestingly, my blog tinkering for this week was supposed to end here, but suddenly GitHub emailed me about a PR and comments. A stranger had forked my blog and made some style adjustments and modifications, adding some features. Later, he even sent me his improved CSS file for reference.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/github_blog_pr.png" alt="github_blog_pr"></p>
<p>Originally, these were just some solutions for personal use, and I often found myself happily tinkering with the theme for an afternoon without writing a word. I didn&rsquo;t expect that some people would notice, appreciate, and adopt it, and even solve many of my problems in return. It feels quite wonderful, and I&rsquo;m starting to feel the joy of open source or working in public. There are always some unexpected gains. So last night, I spent some time tinkering, fixing several style issues that had been problematic for a while but I hadn&rsquo;t fixed or paid attention to, and even added a back-to-top button effect. I was quite happy about it.</p>
<h3 id="server">Server</h3>
<p>As mentioned in a previous weekly review, after figuring out how to set up reverse proxy for my server using <a href="https://nginxproxymanager.com/">Nginx Proxy Manager</a>, I launched several commonly used services and sites, such as the previously mentioned <a href="https://zlib.pseudoyu.com/">zlib.pseudoyu.com</a> book search service. Because it received some attention and was included in some groups and channels, I wanted to continue maintaining it to ensure service stability and access speed. However, previously, these were all low-performance machines that were running at full capacity with just a few services. So, taking advantage of Bandwagon Host&rsquo;s launch of a new decent plan, I got a few machines: 2C2G + 40G hard drive + CN2GIA DC6 line, which is completely sufficient for long-term stable operation of some services.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/yu_services_vps.png" alt="yu_services_vps"></p>
<p>I also had some other machines before, running some of my basic services, with some small applications set up for friends to use. This time, I organized everything well, migrating all services to one machine. Here, I have to praise Docker and docker-compose management methods - the data migration was so seamless. After migrating everything, it only took up about half of the resources, which is great.</p>
<p>Because I now have more machines (a happy problem), I also found an open-source monitoring service for management. It gives me a feeling of being a cyber capitalist, supervising these machines to work hard and not slack off.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/yu_server_status.png" alt="yu_server_status"></p>
<h3 id="desktop-setup-and-keyboard">Desktop Setup and Keyboard</h3>
<p>Perhaps because I don&rsquo;t play games, I&rsquo;m not actually a hardcore keyboard enthusiast. I can hardly tell the difference between different switches and keycaps, and I&rsquo;ve mostly used Mac&rsquo;s built-in scissor-switch keyboards before without feeling any discomfort.</p>
<p>It was probably around the end of 2020 when she asked me if there was anything I&rsquo;d always wanted but couldn&rsquo;t quite bring myself to buy. After thinking for a long time, I said HHKB. Actually, it was more out of curiosity than practical need, and the retro design of the old-style battery compartment was completely in line with my aesthetics.</p>
<p>A few days later, I received it. It was the HHKB Professional Hybrid Type-S silent version, with an old IBM-style color scheme. The electrostatic capacitive feel, combined with its compact size, I really liked it. It also coordinated very well on the desktop.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/keyboard_hhkb_type_s_1.jpg" alt="keyboard_hhkb_type_s_1"></p>
<p>Every morning before starting to study and work, I always arrange my environment a bit, carefully placing the keyboard. This keyboard has accompanied me from Hong Kong to Beijing, and I even bring it every time I go out to a coffee shop. At first, it might have just been a habit, but gradually it became a kind of ritual. It seems to have added some joy to coding and writing.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/keyboard_hhkb_type_s_2.jpg" alt="keyboard_hhkb_type_s_2"></p>
<p>After using it for over a year, because I really liked the feel of the electrostatic capacitive switches, I couldn&rsquo;t help but want to try the remaining few classics. So, also as a gift, I received a RealForce PFU limited edition 87-key keyboard. This one also looks very nice, with a metallic feel in low light environments. However, perhaps because I was used to the special key layout of the HHKB, suddenly switching to an 87-key layout often felt a bit uncomfortable. So it ended up being used more by her for gaming. Anyway, a keyboard can&rsquo;t save my clumsy gaming skills.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/realforce_pfu_87.jpg" alt="realforce_pfu_87"></p>
<p>The RealForce was later left idle. And I really couldn&rsquo;t get used to large-sized keyboards anymore, so I sent it to Ni, who was in Australia. (Come to think of it, my first mechanical keyboard was also a gift from him, a Cherry, though I forgot which switch it had. I used it at home for almost a year when I was still using Windows, and it was quite nice.)</p>
<p>Although HHKB and RealForce seem to be more well-known, in my personal experience, the most exquisitely crafted and best in terms of quality among the three classics of electrostatic capacitive keyboards is actually the Leopold FC660C that I acquired in the middle of last year. The color scheme and typing feel are more comfortable, truly making one enjoy the experience. It subsequently became the main keyboard for my home desktop.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/keyboard_leopold_fc660c.jpg" alt="keyboard_leopold_fc660c"></p>
<p>Actually, at this point, my keyboard usage needs were fully met, and I didn&rsquo;t have much energy to pursue the ultimate or play with customization. However, one late night, I came across &ldquo;<a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV19V4y1J7Hx">【Self-made】I Made a Modular Mechanical Keyboard!【Soft Core】</a>&rdquo; by Zhihui Jun, a keyboard redesigned and defined from circuit hardware to firmware code, all done by himself. Who could resist that?</p>
<p>During the National Day holiday, I happened to see that he had launched a co-branded keyboard with Bilibili. I ordered it without hesitation. Indeed, the pink color is very attractive. This is also my first custom keyboard in a sense.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/keyboard_hello_word_75.jpg" alt="keyboard_hello_word_75"></p>
<p>Then came several months of long waiting, and finally it arrived in my hands this week. I have to say, both the appearance and the feel are excellent. I quickly changed my desktop layout and happily typed away for a week. Maybe appearance is the primary productivity after all. I feel like my article and code output increased this week. Xiaoyu commented, &ldquo;How come your whole persona changed just because of a new keyboard?&rdquo;</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/chat_with_xiaoyu_about_keyboard.png" alt="chat_with_xiaoyu_about_keyboard"></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a collection habit, nor do I want to pursue the ultimate feel or custom solutions. It&rsquo;s just that I&rsquo;ve always had a great desire to tinker with things that I interact with daily, like desktop arrangements, computers, keyboards, and software tools. Even if it&rsquo;s just a few seconds of speed improvement or a little bit of mood enhancement, it&rsquo;s something worth doing for me.</p>

<h3 id="output">Output</h3>
<p>In terms of output, I translated an article for GoCN: &ldquo;<a href="https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2023/01/12/golang_120_language_changes/">Go 1.20 New Changes! Part One: Language Features</a>&rdquo;; after posting last week&rsquo;s review, I met quite a few new friends, and this week I also posted several tweets about blog setup; I have an article scheduled with Sspai, but I&rsquo;m not sure when I&rsquo;ll write it.</p>
<h3 id="input">Input</h3>
<h4 id="books">Books</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>What I Talk About When I Talk About Running</strong>, I started reading this book in October, but various things happened in between and I fell behind on my reading progress. Recently, I&rsquo;ve been slowly reading it in my spare time. I really love Murakami&rsquo;s style of speaking, and I want to read all of his books.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="anime">Anime</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mob Psycho 100</strong>, I watched it once a few years ago and thought the setting was interesting, but didn&rsquo;t really appreciate it in depth. Recently, I wanted to revisit it. The first season has a lot of origins, bonds, and changes of the main characters. While being a funny daily life anime, it also gives people a lot of ideas and thoughts. I binge-watched the second and third seasons. If the first season only described some bonds, the second and third seasons brought me too much emotion. The growth of characters, the changes in people around them, despite the setting of being espers, they constantly self-deny in daily life and self-accept under the influence of people around them. I like the side conversation scene between Mob and Reigen after the press conference the most, emotions are already unspoken.</li>
<li><strong>Bungo Stray Dogs</strong>, I&rsquo;ve heard about it for a long time, just started following it.</li>
<li><strong>The Three-Body Problem</strong>, I guess the mentality of following the drama adaptation is to see what kind of psychedelic operation you can have.</li>

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>This is a record and reflection of my life from January 1, 2023 to January 9, 2023.</p>
<p>This is the first weekly review of 2023. Although the New Year feels like it was just yesterday, the first week of January has already ended. Perhaps my psychological perception of time has become increasingly dull.</p>
<p>During the New Year, I wrote a rather detailed annual summary, recounting the various events of the past year. After finishing, I realized the length had exceeded my expectations. Additionally, I hadn&rsquo;t yet clarified my thoughts on new year plans and expectations, so I skipped that part. Therefore, I&rsquo;ll take this opportunity in this first weekly review of the new year to set some modest goals. Some are small habit formations, while others are long-term plans full of uncertainties. I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ll be able to fulfill them all in the coming year, but listing them out will provide some motivation and serve as a form of self-monitoring.</p>
<p>After staying at home for nearly two months, I finally decided to go out on the weekend to have dinner at a friend&rsquo;s house, enjoying a happy day (otherwise I felt like I had forgotten how to talk to people face-to-face). Although the photo success rate was questionable, I managed to edit the photos and publish two photography collections. I organized my various software and hardware services (an annual ritual, always feeling that I&rsquo;ll have more motivation to start anew after organizing). While organizing, I remembered some previous small projects and set up a website to run <a href="https://zlib.pseudoyu.com/">IPFS version of ZLibrary</a>, which unexpectedly garnered attention, scaring me into optimizing the server and network routes overnight. And many other interesting things happened.</p>
<h2 id="personal-service-restructuring">Personal Service Restructuring</h2>
<h3 id="service-management">Service Management</h3>
<p>Like previous years, I started the year by organizing my various services. I discovered that I now have as many as 20, with half of them being serverless. My skill in utilizing free resources has greatly improved this year. For easier management, I set up a monitoring service using the open-source Uptime Kuma, binding it to a Telegram Bot for alerts, which gave me much more peace of mind.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/uptime_kuma_yu_services.png" alt="uptime_kuma_yu_services"></p>
<p>Interestingly, I always found managing websites on servers troublesome. Every time I needed to migrate or change services, it was always a headache. So I hosted most of my services on Railway, Vercel, Supabase, and other Serverless platforms. Since most are personal services without high configuration requirements, as long as they&rsquo;re safe and stable, it&rsquo;s enough. I hadn&rsquo;t bothered with Nginx reverse proxy, https certificates, and such.</p>
<p>As I mentioned before, I&rsquo;ve been helping an anime-loving friend with Bilibili livestream management and technical support. I thought about using a free Oracle Japan machine specifically for livestream monitoring and automatic recording. Sometimes my friend also needs to be able to view and download directly, so naturally, a memorable domain name, access speed under domestic network conditions, download bandwidth, etc., all need to be considered. Serverless services were far from sufficient (and not very cost-effective), so I explored some solutions and chose <a href="https://nginxproxymanager.com/">Nginx Proxy Manager</a>, a convenient reverse proxy tool.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/npm_yu_dashboard.png" alt="npm_yu_dashboard"></p>
<p>I deployed it on a BandwagonHost machine with a good network connection (CN2 GIA) to host my various services, ensuring a decent access experience. It can also directly issue https certificates for my <code>*.pseudoyu.com</code> subdomains through wildcard matching and automatic renewal, which is very convenient. Combined with the aforementioned monitoring, I&rsquo;ve been using it for a week now, and it&rsquo;s quite comfortable.</p>
<p>The official documentation is clear and detailed, and with the user-friendly container service management method of docker-compose, it&rsquo;s quick to get started. However, I might still consider creating a tutorial later to provide reference for friends who want to host small services like blogs.</p>
<h3 id="rss-input">RSS Input</h3>
<p>In 2022, I mostly focused on blog output and my Telegram channel, without putting much thought into input and synchronization across various platforms. This led to an accumulation of RSS subscriptions, and newsletters also became somewhat overwhelming. I wasn&rsquo;t able to properly filter my input information sources. So I deleted NetNewsWire, which I had been using for a long time, and set up a more lightweight Miniflux using Railway + Supabase as my main reader. I also filtered my RSS information sources, limiting them to 52, almost all personal blogs. I will continue to optimize and adjust in the future.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/miniflux_yu_page.png" alt="miniflux_yu_page"></p>
<p>Although Miniflux provides a decent reading experience, I actually prefer clicking into the original article. I always feel that for personal blogs, it&rsquo;s not just about the content; the website&rsquo;s style design, some related articles and themes are all integral parts of the blogger, which can bring a more complete reading enjoyment.</p>
<p>For me, the RSS reader serves more as a first-step aggregation tool. Since Miniflux is a web-based service, it can&rsquo;t provide very timely notifications. As I heavily rely on Telegram every day, I set up my own Telegram notification based on <a href="https://github.com/Rongronggg9/RSS-to-Telegram-Bot">RSS to Telegram Bot</a> to push updates from these information sources to me. When I see some interesting titles, I make a mental note and then go to Miniflux to read and check them all at once when I have free time.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/yu_rss_to_tg_bot.png" alt="yu_rss_to_tg_bot"></p>
<p>This way, I&rsquo;m less likely to miss articles I want to read, and it doesn&rsquo;t cause too much information buildup. This setup has been working very well so far. Incidentally, seeing various weekly reviews every weekend also has a significant prompting effect (<del>I went out to play on Sunday, reasonably delayed the update</del>).</p>
<h3 id="telegram-output">Telegram Output</h3>
<p>I also set up my own n8n synchronization service based on Railway + Supabase to synchronize my input from various platforms to my channel. For a detailed description, you can refer to this article &ldquo;[[Weekly Review #12 - Cyber Space, Self-Definition and Boundaries](https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2022/09/19/weekly_review_20220919/)&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Previously, the platform was based on <a href="https://github.com/reorx">Reorx&rsquo;s</a> solution with some of my own adjustments, but I hadn&rsquo;t added more information sources, and there were fewer domestic sources.</p>
<p>Although I currently rarely share on various domestic platforms, it&rsquo;s still part of myself. Additionally, I added Sspai as a publishing channel for some of my work efficiency articles. So after my friend <a href="https://blog.tujunjie.com/">Tujunjie</a> recommended the integration of RSSHub and n8n, I deployed a set of <a href="https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub">RSSHub</a> services on my server to try it out. I immediately found it to be an impressive solution and quickly added synchronization support for NetEase Cloud Music, Weibo, Bilibili, and Sspai to my Telegram information flow channel, making the content more enriched.</p>
<h3 id="crossbell-synchronization">Crossbell Synchronization</h3>
<p>Although platforms like Twitter and Telegram are relatively large, they are still centralized products. With the recent various upheavals, I always feel uneasy about using Telegram as the final station for aggregating these information sources, especially when I often almost accidentally click to delete all messages when trying to delete a single message (strange user experience). Therefore, the synchronization and export of information is also a very important link.</p>
<p>The Side Project I mentioned before is also doing something like this, but as a Web3 practitioner, I&rsquo;ve naturally been eyeing blockchain-based solutions for a long time. In fact, my graduation project was a <a href="https://github.com/pseudoyu/uright">ÐApp for data ownership protection based on Ethereum and IPFS</a>, but that paper-thin Demo project naturally couldn&rsquo;t meet my various needs, and the code was written so messily that I had no desire to refactor it. So I started looking for on-chain solutions.</p>
<p>I had been following <a href="https://crossbell.io/">Crossbell</a> for a long time, and by some strange coincidence, I got to know quite a few friends from <a href="https://rss3.io/">RSS3</a>. But my previous impression of Crossbell was still limited to the <a href="https://crosssync.app/">CrossSync</a> browser plugin that <a href="https://diygod.me/">Diygod</a> posted on Twitter, which was based on this chain. At that time, I opened the link on my phone, and it wasn&rsquo;t convenient to associate the wallet, so I put it aside.</p>
<p>So I thought about visiting the official website, and to my surprise, I found that there were already several applications like <a href="https://xlog.app/">xLog</a>, <a href="https://xsync.app/">xSync</a>, <a href="https://xchar.app/">xChar</a>, <a href="https://crossbell.io/feed">xFeed</a>, etc. The xSync that I was most concerned about happened to support Telegram Channel, perfectly matching my needs.</p>
<h4 id="xlog-synchronous-blog-publishing">xLog Synchronous Blog Publishing</h4>
<p>So I started a series of configurations and decorations. First, I synchronized my personal reflection-related blog posts to xLog. The visual effect and experience are good, and it&rsquo;s very convenient to follow and comment based on the Crossbell address.</p>
<p>This is my xLog access address: <a href="https://xlog.pseudoyu.com/">xlog.pseudoyu.com</a>. Interested friends can also follow it. However, due to considerations of customization level, various historical article migration routing issues, changes in my various data statistics services, etc., it&rsquo;s still more of a synchronization distribution channel for now. I don&rsquo;t plan to completely migrate my blog over for the time being.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/yu_xlog_homepage.png" alt="yu_xlog_homepage"></p>
<p>The built-in <a href="https://xlog.pseudoyu.com/nft">NFT showcase</a> is very nice, probably integrated with <a href="https://unidata.app/">Unidata</a>. I had wanted to integrate it into my Hugo blog before, but never got around to it (<del>having a ready-made one made me even lazier</del>).</p>

<p>I was really excited when I saw that xSync could synchronize Telegram Channel data. It didn&rsquo;t require any modifications to make another backup and archive of my aggregated channel, and I quickly configured it. <del>I suddenly felt the urge to abandon my own Side Project</del>.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/yu_xsync_homepage.png" alt="yu_xsync_homepage"></p>
<p>However, it&rsquo;s a bit regrettable that only part of the historical data was synchronized. There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be an option for manual backup synchronization of data from before the integration, and I don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s a configuration item or future feature that can solve this. If any RSS3 friends know of a solution, please let me know. Thanks!</p>
<p>After everything is configured, you can view all your messages through xChar. It&rsquo;s a perfect solution. This is my xCharacter personal homepage: <a href="https://xchar.app/pseudoyu">xchar.app/pseudoyu</a>, where you can also view my information flow.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/yu_xchar_profile.png" alt="yu_xchar_profile"></p>
<p>Another small anecdote is that when I saw that I needed to put <code>pseudoyu@crossbell</code> in the profile, I smiled. When I was doing my graduation project on copyright protection ÐApp, I used the Oraclize API in the Solidity contract to access off-chain data, which also grabbed the unique identifier from the YouTube description as proof of account ownership. It gave me a strange sense of familiarity, haha. I&rsquo;ll have a chance to study the code later.</p>
<p>This Crossbell-based information input and output solution can be said to have restructured my original personal management system. I hope to make some of my own attempts based on this system.</p>
<h2 id="new-years-plans">New Year&rsquo;s Plans</h2>
<p>It seems that listing some annual plans has become an unwritten habit every year, but in so many years of my past, there have been few that I&rsquo;ve actually followed through and achieved. This year, I&rsquo;ve added more public expression channels, which seems to give me more motivation to practice.</p>
<p>I previously read <a href="https://xuanwo.io/">Xuanwo&rsquo;s</a> article &ldquo;<a href="https://xuanwo.io/reports/2022-37/">2022-37: Public workflow based on Github</a>&rdquo;, and after a bit of research on GitHub Projects, I found it to be simple yet sufficient. Although I usually do some basic GTD based on Logseq, it&rsquo;s still difficult to use as a kanban board. I&rsquo;ll try it this year, and also give myself some corresponding pressure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to control the granularity of New Year&rsquo;s plans, so I&rsquo;ll just go with the flow. I won&rsquo;t write those big and empty ones anymore. It&rsquo;s more about some indicators. Some are ideas for free exploration, some are long-term goals, and some are short-term things to accomplish. I&rsquo;ve adopted a checkbox format. Maybe I&rsquo;ll continue to add more as I think of them later. I&rsquo;ll come back to check and review when I complete them or during the year-end summary of the new year.</p>

<h2 id="personal-life-snippets">Personal Life Snippets</h2>
<p>Since the severe epidemic in Beijing in November, I&rsquo;ve been living at home for two months. Perhaps I have decent physical defense attributes (referring to sending the only bit of medicine I had on hand to a friend at the time, relying purely on not going out to isolate from the virus) and luck points (ordering takeout as usual every day, and even having property management come to my home to deal with a water leak for an afternoon), I&rsquo;ve managed to remain negative until now, already in the final round.</p>
<p>But the consequence is that friends who have already recovered and turned negative are traveling everywhere, while I&rsquo;m still fully armed just to take out the trash, let alone dare to travel far. So I spent these two months with my cat.</p>
<p>Although I&rsquo;m indeed staying at home, as the epidemic opened up, there seemed to be no end in sight. So my mindset became more relaxed. This weekend, I was invited (<del>not really, just using the pretext of visiting with my cat</del>) to go to senior Bo Yi&rsquo;s house for dinner. I breathed in the not-so-fresh air outside (<del>after all, it&rsquo;s Beijing</del>), and also ate home-cooked meals that I hadn&rsquo;t had in a long time. I lounged around all day, but felt content and happy.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/wonderful_meal_with_boyi.jpg" alt="wonderful_meal_with_boyi"></p>
<p>I plan to return to Hangzhou on January 18th. Actually, in 2022, my time at home was not short compared to recent years. With various adjusted holidays and vacations, it added up to about a month before and after going home. It&rsquo;s just that the epidemic often recurred, and I didn&rsquo;t have the chance to return to my hometown. Two years ago in January, my grandmother passed away, and I was stuck in Hong Kong due to the epidemic and couldn&rsquo;t go home. Last Spring Festival, I was stranded in Beijing again due to a sudden outbreak. It&rsquo;s time to go back and see. As I grow older, I go to more and more places, but home seems to be getting farther and farther away.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been hesitating about going home for a while, worried about any changes, but still want to go back and see. However, in this situation, I&rsquo;m not comfortable leaving my cat with a pet hotel or unfamiliar people. Later, when I casually mentioned this during a meeting, I found a solution. I decided to have Nini stay at the home of my project&rsquo;s small leader. His daughter has been eyeing a cat for a long time. After settling this, I finally felt relieved.</p>
<p>With all this trouble, I&rsquo;m likely to get infected. Knowing this, senior Bo Yi gave me a luxurious anti-epidemic gift package, which was touching.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/medicines_from_boyi.jpg" alt="medicines_from_boyi"></p>
<p>Then a while ago, when senior Bo Yi was at Lingyin Temple, she made a wish for me: &ldquo;May 2023 allow you to do what you like and explore more hobbies as you wish.&rdquo; She also brought me a beautiful Buddhist bracelet. I unilaterally declare her the best senior in the world. I hope the new year will be good for her too.</p>
<p>Suddenly I remembered that when I was in university, I wore a Buddhist bracelet from Lingyin Temple that Ni gave me for more than a year, until the string was almost worn out and the beads were about to fall off before I put it away. I strangely felt that I was indeed luckier that year. Sometimes maybe you just need some peace of mind.</p>
<p>I will go back to fulfill the wish, a double wish.</p>

<h2 id="other">Other</h2>
<p>This section will record some of my inputs and outputs, as well as other things I find interesting.</p>
<p>This week, I watched two very touching videos on Bilibili. One is from my favorite Up主 &ldquo;<a href="https://space.bilibili.com/37029661">Xiaolu Lawrence</a>&rdquo; titled &ldquo;<a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Mx4y1G7zW">This is my most hardworking year, but it made the company shrink by half | 2022 Year-end Summary</a>&rdquo;. I had some thoughts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been watching for several consecutive years, and always watch this reserved year-end summary column many, many times.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve felt empathy when I was at the same stage, being moved by some videos; I&rsquo;ve been happy for many, many days when Lu-ge replied to and encouraged my dynamic; More often, he accompanied me through one night after another, waking up to continue living with effort. Perhaps due to familiarity, the slight pause when first opening the new studio door, the choke when saying &ldquo;because the support of family was once your confidence&rdquo;, the BGM of the bouquet, the bitter laugh when reviewing this year, all made my emotions fluctuate and tears fall.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that you&rsquo;ve changed as you&rsquo;ve grown up, but that you&rsquo;ve grown up, and the world has begun to reveal all its truths to you&rdquo;. Perhaps the often-described youthfulness and student air about me is just the overdraft of the luck I&rsquo;ve experienced in the past, and the protection of those around me, allowing me to talk about myself again and again in my weekly reports, longing for beauty again and again. And in 2022, everything has returned to the starting point. Fortunately, I still retain the habit of &ldquo;recording&rdquo; and haven&rsquo;t lost the ability to &ldquo;feel&rdquo;. Small, but precious.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;This year, I&rsquo;ve lost too much, too much. Any small death and collapse becomes unbearable&rdquo;. Yes, 2022 was just too difficult, indescribable. In the new year, I have to struggle to live alone.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Thank you, Lu-ge, for your companionship and the emotions you&rsquo;ve brought over the past year. In the new year, let&rsquo;s keep going!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a very sharp Up主 &ldquo;<a href="https://space.bilibili.com/119801456">Lao Jiang Ju Kao Pu</a>&rdquo; with &ldquo;<a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV17M411y7es">Say goodbye to the indescribable and unnecessary year - My New Year&rsquo;s Address</a>&rdquo;. My thoughts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I really like Lao Jiang&rsquo;s thinking and narrative style, plain, sincere but bold and not lacking in sharpness. It&rsquo;s the best New Year&rsquo;s address I&rsquo;ve seen.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>2022 just passed like this, many things can&rsquo;t be said, many things are happening, many things will never happen again, indescribable is probably the best description.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>The first week of 2023, this year is off to a pretty good start.</p>

<p>It has been over a year since I came to Beijing. Due to long periods of staying in my small room and lacking the mood to explore, its four seasons have merely been the changing greenery on my way to work. I haven&rsquo;t even visited the most well-known landmarks.</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;ve moved between quite a few cities over the years. Each time, I always thought, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s still time,&rdquo; &ldquo;There are plenty of days ahead,&rdquo; &ldquo;There will always be a chance,&rdquo; yet often left with many regrets. It wasn&rsquo;t until nearly December that I realized it was already late autumn, and the red leaves of Xiangshan I had planned to see might only have remnants left. Nevertheless, I decided to capture some traces of autumn through my lens.</p>
<p>I had previously read Lin Yutang&rsquo;s &ldquo;Moment In Peking,&rdquo; which carries many joys and sorrows of this city and sketched my first impression of Beijing. So I named this photography collection &ldquo;Moment In Peking (The Autumn).&rdquo; Although the autumn spirit has almost dissipated, it remains a piece of city memory.</p>
<p>Special thanks to senior Boyi, who just got her driver&rsquo;s license and was willing to rent a car and take me there when the pandemic had already worsened (<del>one dares to drive, one dares to ride</del>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As this is a photography collection, I don&rsquo;t want to compress the image quality in this column. Each photo is quite large and hosted on Alibaba Cloud OSS (billing alert ⚠️). Loading might be a bit slow, please bear with me.</p>

<p>Since November, I&rsquo;ve been wanting to take proper photos of Nini, but the lighting at home isn&rsquo;t ideal. Due to a busy work schedule, I hadn&rsquo;t deliberately purchased backdrop or lighting equipment. Today, while editing the photos (I mainly just adjust the colors, being lazy), I felt the final images weren&rsquo;t entirely satisfactory. However, I can&rsquo;t abandon my New Year&rsquo;s Day resolution, so I asked a friend to select a few photos that seemed acceptable. It&rsquo;s a good start, at least.</p>
<p>My photographic enlightenment came from a documentary journalist and filmmaker, so I actually pay more attention to composition and elements in the frame. I always hope that each photograph I take has a sense of story and theme (<del>low EQ: lack of technical skill</del>). Because I love this photo of the cat in the box so much, I named this special collection &ldquo;Cat In The Box&rdquo;. There&rsquo;s also a scene where the cat happens to be standing on a Murakami book I was halfway through reading. Recalling Murakami&rsquo;s descriptions of cats in his books, which initially sparked my urgent desire to have a cat, it feels like a peculiar fate. So I named that one &ldquo;Cat and Haruki Murakami&rdquo;. There are also a few shots taken before bedtime, where the lighting is so dark that post-processing couldn&rsquo;t salvage it. But I find them genuinely adorable (it&rsquo;s the photographer&rsquo;s problem), so I&rsquo;ve included them as extras, titled &ldquo;Silence&rdquo; (yes, I&rsquo;ve been a bit obsessed with the Japanese drama &ldquo;Shizuka na Yuki&rdquo; recently).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been about two years since I last properly picked up a camera to capture anything. I want to start documenting life again and put more effort into photography (<del>previously relied purely on mystical aesthetics and photogenic models</del>). So I&rsquo;ve added a new photography collection column to the project module of my blog, which will serve as a check-in for my photography improvement plan. In the new year, I also want to take more photos of Nini.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As this is a photography collection, I don&rsquo;t want to compromise on image quality. Each photo is close to 10MB, hosted on Alibaba Cloud OSS (billing alert ⚠️). Loading might be a bit slow, please bear with me.</p>

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>Today is the last day of 2022. As I mentioned in my previous weekly review:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There will be an annual summary, covering various events of my year - things lost, things gained, things to be grateful for, and inevitable regrets. Though I hesitated about bringing up certain topics again, I decided to face them truthfully. After all, everything expires, even canned pineapples. This year too shall pass. It was these joys and sorrows that shaped my 2022, and shaped a more complete version of myself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I set the goal of writing a year-end review early on, intending to spend a few days crafting it carefully. Yet I (unsurprisingly) procrastinated until the afternoon of the 31st.</p>
<p>During my gap year in 2019, my job at the time often required travel. In half a year, I flew over 30 times. When the trips were frequent, I would often wake up disoriented on planes, not knowing which city I was in or what I was doing for a few seconds. Though I spent most of this year in my little room, I experienced a similar feeling.</p>
<p>It seems that ever since graduating from university, unexpected events occur every year that can easily alter the course of my life. But perhaps that&rsquo;s what makes life interesting.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;ve found an outlet for my desire to share through the people around me. In previous years, I felt life was already beautiful and sufficient, so I didn&rsquo;t treat the new year as a particularly meaningful milestone. But this year, I feel compelled to record something. I suppose I&rsquo;ve reached the age where I use words to combat forgetfulness. As I began writing this review, I realized this past year has been a turning point for me in various aspects, in a curious way.</p>
<p>Although I couldn&rsquo;t attend the graduation ceremony in person, I received my degree and international student certification from HKU in January, officially leaving school. Also in early January, I applied for a permanent position, starting my first blockchain development job. In April, I successfully delivered my first project as the technical lead. In May, I went through a breakup. In June, I revived my long-abandoned blog, started writing weekly reviews, and began using Twitter to document my daily life. In July, I went back home for a visit, regaining a sense of belonging in life. In October, I adopted a cat - a lovely silver tabby - which brightened up my life considerably. In December, due to the pandemic, I&rsquo;ve been staying at home spending time with &ldquo;Nini&rdquo; and started working on some side projects, bringing me a little closer to my dream of independent development.</p>
<p>It seems I&rsquo;ve taken on many new identities and experienced numerous emotional changes this year, from the confusion of starting work to the lowest point in my life, then to regaining my spirits and making changes. Looking back from this vantage point, I&rsquo;m surprised at how much can happen in just a few short months. If I had to choose a theme for this year, I would pick &ldquo;Transitions.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="people-im-grateful-for">People I&rsquo;m Grateful For</h2>
<p>There are many people I&rsquo;m thankful for in my life this year.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m grateful to my sweet partner for accompanying me through the most confusing and anxious period in the first half of the year. Even though we couldn&rsquo;t continue our journey together, I hope she&rsquo;s doing well. Despite being in three different locations, Ni and Zhan listened to my confessions during many late nights, keeping me company in my sadness. Many of my subsequent thoughts on life and relationships stem from their encouragement. Although Xiaoyu and I often disappear from each other&rsquo;s lives, it seems we can always have a heart-to-heart conversation that lasts all night with just one phone call. Each time we talk, I regain my anticipation for life. At the same time, she has both assisted and witnessed the budding and fruition of a relationship - I hope she continues to be happy. My parents&rsquo; daily care always makes me feel warm, and chatting with my sister Xuanxuan brings me a lot of joy. Every time I return to Hangzhou, I look forward to meeting with my middle school homeroom teacher, Brother Chun. It seems only this kind of friendship-like interaction that has remained unchanged for over a decade can make me feel as if time has stood still (although he&rsquo;s always most curious about my romantic experiences and then scolds me for being a scoundrel).</p>
<p>The daily interactions and somewhat literary exchanges with Ledi make us feel as if we&rsquo;ve returned to our university days. We also strategize for each other&rsquo;s &ldquo;relationships,&rdquo; although they all end in tragedy. Senior Xiaoyu and Xuchong accompanied me to drink and vent at my emotional low point. Of course, I gradually realized that alcohol doesn&rsquo;t solve problems, so I quit. The care from Xiaoyu, Caomuhuii, Jingru, and Tu&rsquo;er makes me feel that I&rsquo;m still worthy of having some friends. Senior Boyi&rsquo;s lifestyle makes me believe that work and life can truly be balanced. I&rsquo;m also grateful for the several times she hosted me for meals, making me feel that Beijing isn&rsquo;t so lonely after all. And many, many more.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thankful for everyone&rsquo;s companionship and the emotions they&rsquo;ve stirred in me this year. I hope in the days to come, you&rsquo;ll all be safe and happy, and that life treats you gently.</p>
<h2 id="relationships-and-renewed-living">Relationships and Renewed Living</h2>
<p>In the days after parting, I spent several months slowing down, sincerely experiencing and feeling life itself, trying to recover those bits and pieces I had lost while moving forward in confusion.</p>
<p>Starting from the birthday summary &ldquo;A Confession at 25: Love Like a Bouquet&rdquo; that I wrote with great emotional turmoil at the time but now seems somewhat overly ornate in retrospect, I pondered on &ldquo;Emotions, Security, and Living Seriously&rdquo;, attempting to regain my &ldquo;Health, Goals, and Rhythm of Life&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of a short holiday after a project ended, I went back to Hangzhou and reflected on &ldquo;Family Bonds and the Sense of Belonging to a City&rdquo;. Occasionally, there would be emotional ripples caused by the quiet erasure of traces of our time together. After discovering that those past lives and connections were &ldquo;404 Not Found&rdquo;, I began planning to adopt another cat to give myself something to look forward to and depend on.</p>
<p>Inspired by a book by Murakami, I started to contemplate my &ldquo;Personality and the Essence of Life&rdquo;. Several sleepless nights of chatting with old friends made me think of the more distant past, reminiscing about &ldquo;The Past, Regrets, and the Present&rdquo;.</p>
<p>During an unexpected business trip to Qingdao, I designed &ldquo;An Unexpected Journey&rdquo; for myself, experiencing beauty during the trip and reconciling with a part of my inner obsessions. During the National Day holiday, due to a sudden emotional fluctuation, my life that had just started to improve took a noticeable downturn. I went through a difficult time, &ldquo;Putting Life and Self on Hold&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I increasingly realized the weight of accumulated emotions. So shortly after returning to Beijing, I went to a cat shelter and, due to an instant connection, adopted a lovely silver tabby that week, returning to &ldquo;The Life of Him and His Cat&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The days spent with the cat are quiet and beautiful. I&rsquo;ve experienced &ldquo;Companionship and Another Kind of Life&rdquo;, and slowly started to pick up my phone and camera again to casually record the beautiful moments in life. I never imagined a cat could bring such a big change to me, as if I had &ldquo;Picked Up Life Again&rdquo;. On Christmas Eve, I watched &ldquo;Love Actually&rdquo; and reconsidered love and life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m somewhat glad that I decided to start recording everything in the form of weekly reviews at that time. When looking back, I can string together the scattered thoughts and feelings I recorded over the past six months into a line, seeing my changes and the flow of life. I don&rsquo;t know where and how I&rsquo;ll feel in the new year, how I&rsquo;ll change in various aspects, but I&rsquo;ll continue to record these fragments of my growth.</p>
<h2 id="personality-and-change">Personality and Change</h2>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/yu_personality_infj.png" alt="yu_personality_infj"></p>
<p>Last night, I suddenly realized it had been a long time since I took a personality test. I might have changed quite a bit, so I took one. I remember being an ENTJ in college, then briefly changing to INTJ, but often wavering. After all the events of the past year or two, I&rsquo;ve surprisingly become an INFJ. I was quite shocked.</p>
<p>Perhaps it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;ve turned more of my self-pursuit and exploration towards &ldquo;introspection rather than external seeking&rdquo;, and my weekly reviews also lean more towards inner thoughts and emotions. My introverted tendencies and inclination towards feelings have become increasingly apparent.</p>
<p>I used to be someone who perhaps pursued self-interest excessively, sometimes rational to the point of seeming cold. I would only show polite concern for others&rsquo; lives, even for those closest to me, often prioritizing myself. This trait might have been helpful when forging ahead alone, but life is complex and fluid. Relationships between people are often not just about one-sided compromise. It&rsquo;s a simple truth, but difficult to achieve when you&rsquo;re in the midst of it.</p>
<h2 id="the-three-things-that-changed-the-most">The Three Things That Changed the Most</h2>
<p>I often see people summarizing their changes over the year during year-end reviews. I&rsquo;ll follow suit and list three items. These aren&rsquo;t carefully considered major events, just some things that stood out in my memory upon reflection. Of course, I&rsquo;ve already mentioned a lot about relationships above, so I don&rsquo;t want to dwell on that topic too much.</p>
<h3 id="raising-nini">Raising Nini</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/my_cat_nie_nie_28.jpg" alt="my_cat_nie_nie_28"></p>
<p>&ldquo;Nini&rdquo; is my cat. We&rsquo;ve been living together for two months since I brought her home on October 30th.</p>
<p>Raising a cat alone is actually quite a challenge for me (after all, I&rsquo;m truly capable of not eating for two or three days, barely sleeping, and being immersed in my own world in front of the computer, living an extremely rough life). I went through a lot of hesitation, but the moment I saw her, I had almost made up my mind.</p>
<p>Everything seemed to start from scratch. I&rsquo;ve learned a lot in these two months, and it has changed me in many ways. I hope we can continue to live healthily in the new year.</p>
<p>The Christmas decorations were delayed due to shipping, so they haven&rsquo;t arrived yet. Tomorrow I&rsquo;ll update with a series of &ldquo;Cat In the Box&rdquo; photos I took earlier. (If you&rsquo;re only interested in seeing Nini, you can stop reading now.)</p>
<h3 id="using-shuangpin-input-method">Using Shuangpin Input Method</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/shuangpin_input_preview.png" alt="shuangpin_input_preview"></p>
<p>Since I first encountered computers in elementary school, I&rsquo;ve been using pinyin input method (full pinyin), which is the common nine-key or 26-key layout we&rsquo;re used to. This habit had persisted for over a decade. In May, I suddenly wanted to make a change. It wasn&rsquo;t purely about improving typing speed, I just wanted to try something new, to see how hard it is to change a habit that has become second nature (this person keeps saying he&rsquo;s not talking about relationships, but every sentence is about relationships).</p>
<p>Shuangpin is a different key layout where you only need to press two keys (initial consonant + final vowel) to type any character. So there were many things to get used to at first. Although it only took an afternoon to memorize the key positions, it took about half a month to convert the habit. I wanted to switch back countless times, but after getting through the painful period, it turned out not to be that difficult.</p>
<p>See? It&rsquo;s not that difficult after all.</p>
<h3 id="new-hair-color">New Hair Color</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/yu_selfish_2022.jpg" alt="yu_selfish_2022"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I rarely have photos of myself, and I only realized after taking this that the mirror was so dirty it didn&rsquo;t need to be censored.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This change itself isn&rsquo;t a big one, but I rarely make such attempts. In July, I dyed my hair green, and after it faded, I changed to blue in October. The latter makes me feel more like an anime otaku, fulfilling a sort of second dimension dream. I suppose I can only experiment like this now while I still have a lot of hair. For now, I&rsquo;ll keep the blue color.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also a way to change my mood through change.</p>
<h2 id="learning-input-and-output">Learning, Input, and Output</h2>
<h3 id="work">Work</h3>
<p>This year, I had less contact with my leader, Tao, on projects, but his ideas and attitudes towards technology still deeply influence me. I&rsquo;ve probably improved my Go development engineering skills quite a bit under the torment of several projects, and I&rsquo;ve also gained a good foundation in docker, k8s, and various CI/CD tools, as well as doing a lot of exploration on my own.</p>
<p>I systematically learned some knowledge about Solidity smart contract development and produced a related introductory tutorial series - &ldquo;Blockchain Beginner&rsquo;s Guide&rdquo;. In the second half of the year&rsquo;s projects, I also did some work tasks related to contract development and chain interaction. Overall, it&rsquo;s been a happy and growth-filled year.</p>
<p>Although the work atmosphere and methods are already quite free, I often feel some drain from work. I&rsquo;m considering some forms of Web3 remote work or new opportunities, and I might possibly return to Hong Kong. In the new year, it might be appropriate to make some changes.</p>
<h3 id="technology">Technology</h3>
<p>Outside of work, I&rsquo;ve done some fun explorations, unlocking some basic frontend development skills. I can now do some small projects and tools combining with my existing technology stack. In the future, I can introduce myself as &ldquo;a backend developer who can cobble together some frontend&rdquo; or maybe shamelessly add &ldquo;pseudo full-stack&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that learning frontend technology itself is particularly exciting, but it allows me to independently create some of my own products and better solve some problems, getting closer to my original intention of doing technology.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learned the basics of Rust, but haven&rsquo;t used it in practice yet. I hope to make some progress in the new year. As for the planned LeetCode algorithm practice, I haven&rsquo;t implemented it yet. It&rsquo;s also a key plan for the new year, although it&rsquo;s indeed hard to persist.</p>
<p>I continued to contribute nearly 10 articles and participated in two books in the <a href="https://gocn.vip/">GoCN</a> translation team, and also took charge of various CI/CD tasks. I participated in the English translation team for SlowMist&rsquo;s &ldquo;Blockchain Dark Forest Self-Rescue Manual&rdquo;, making some small contributions to Web3.</p>
<h3 id="language">Language</h3>
<p>This year, I focused a lot on cultivating my English listening, reading, and writing skills. I&rsquo;ve made some progress. I can watch English tutorials and podcasts at 1.5x speed, watch the American TV series &ldquo;Silicon Valley&rdquo; without subtitles, and handle some technical translations and writings quite well. However, my spoken English is still somewhat lacking. Plus, I rarely practice, so it&rsquo;s a relatively weak link. Improving outside an English environment really depends on willpower.</p>
<p>The originally planned Japanese review (which is basically equivalent to preview) has been put on hold. I&rsquo;ll start tracking my learning progress in the weekly review in the new year.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve only reviewed some basic German vocabulary and phrases. If only I had been more serious when learning a second foreign language back then. Now I really regret it. I won&rsquo;t set any goals for this one, it&rsquo;ll be up to fate.</p>
<h3 id="reading-and-media">Reading and Media</h3>
<p>To synchronize with my Telegram channel, I started using Douban this year to record my reading, media consumption, and gaming. The media data isn&rsquo;t very meaningful as some of it was retroactively added, so I won&rsquo;t include it here.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/yu_2022_review_book.png" alt="yu_2022_review_book"></p>
<p>I read quite a few books in the second half of this year, mostly during commutes and lunch breaks. I didn&rsquo;t deliberately pursue any quantity, but when I organized it, I suddenly found that I had already read 30 books. I feel like I&rsquo;ve regained some of the mood and joy of reading and writing. My favorite author is Maugham. In one of his reading essays, there&rsquo;s a line that says &ldquo;Reading is a portable sanctuary&rdquo;, which I&rsquo;ve deeply felt in the past half year. In books, you can see many different worlds and many different lives. It&rsquo;s wonderful.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also watched quite a few shows. Various movies, TV series, and anime add up to probably over 100. I&rsquo;ve tried to appreciate them seriously. I guess my Douban literary persona is pretty solid now. I received two Douban movie calendars and a movie screening weekly calendar from two different friends. I&rsquo;ll continue to watch more in the coming year.</p>
<p>Because I wanted to record these traces, I also started adding my thoughts on Douban after finishing books and media. I feel this method also makes me more attentive when watching or reading. Although they&rsquo;re all short comments, they&rsquo;ve accumulated to 8,932 words without me realizing it.</p>
<h2 id="year-end-data">Year-End Data</h2>
<p>I guess I&rsquo;ve been influenced by her to some extent. My formerly casual and disorderly self seems to want to present some small growth in a data-driven way this year.</p>
<h3 id="revived-blog">Revived Blog</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/yu_2022_review_umami_data.png" alt="yu_2022_review_umami_data"></p>
<p>I started writing on WeChat Official Accounts and blogs very early on, but given the frequency of updates and content in the past, it could hardly be called an independent blog. Starting with an article &ldquo;It&rsquo;s 2022, Let&rsquo;s Talk About Why I&rsquo;m Still Blogging&rdquo; in May, I revived <a href="https://www.pseudoyu.com/">my blog</a>. This year, I updated exactly 48 blog posts, although almost all were updated in the second half of the year (but rounded up, I updated weekly). About half of these were weekly reviews and articles related to thoughts and emotions, while the other half were technical blogs and articles about productivity tools. This aligns well with my positioning for content output and desire to share. It&rsquo;s a good start.</p>
<p>With the continuous update of blog posts, I&rsquo;ve gained some readers&rsquo; attention. From mid-June, I set up a data statistics system through umami. As I put more effort into output each month, the monthly page views (PV) have reached 12k+, and monthly unique visitors (UV) have reached 4k+, maintaining a good growth trend. It&rsquo;s gratifying to see that my output has received some recognition. I often smile when I open the statistics interface at midnight and see prompts like &ldquo;5 people currently online&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I also often receive comments of thanks or encouragement. Before I knew it, there were many pages of comments. I&rsquo;m very grateful for the heartfelt messages and comments from these strangers I&rsquo;ve never met. I&rsquo;m happy that my words can change or inspire some people. I also appreciate that in an era when blogs are declining, they are still willing to &ldquo;waste&rdquo; some of their time to convey some thoughts to me in this way, even if it&rsquo;s just a simple blessing or thanks. I&rsquo;ve selected some to share at the end of this annual review. I hope you&rsquo;ll continue to accompany me in the coming year.</p>
<h3 id="twitter">Twitter</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/yu_2022_review_twitter.png" alt="yu_2022_review_twitter"></p>
<p>Perhaps it&rsquo;s because I gradually got used to the way of outputting to the outside world through my blog, or perhaps it&rsquo;s because my desire to share had nowhere to go as my life changed. I activated my Twitter account in the middle of the year. Originally, I just wanted it to be like a private Weibo. In the early stages, I only posted some late-night emotions.</p>
<p>Later, as I shared my weekly reports and chatted with friends like <a href="https://twitter.com/strrlthedev">STRRL</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/RealAkemiHomura">Homura</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Manjusaka_Lee">Manjusaka</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/_a_wing">Xinyi</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/OnlyXuanwo">Xuanwo</a>, I felt everyone&rsquo;s friendliness and started sharing more of my daily life. Before I knew it, I had posted 514 tweets (this person talks quite a lot), gained 600+ followers, and even managed to mutually follow tech bloggers like <a href="https://twitter.com/yihong0618">yihong</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/GeekPlux">GeekPlux</a> who were previously only in my aspirational following list. Occasionally, we have some very interesting interactions.</p>
<p>Thank you to these friends for not minding me.</p>
<h3 id="telegram-channel">Telegram Channel</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/yu_2022_review_tg.png" alt="yu_2022_review_tg"></p>
<p>In a previous weekly review &ldquo;Weekly Review #12 - Cyberspace, Self-Definition and Boundaries&rdquo;, I mentioned that I had set up my own Telegram channel to synchronize my various Twitter posts, comments, likes, etc. Originally, it was just an archive for me to find material for my weekly reports, but before I knew it, it had 251 subscribers. I&rsquo;ve also received thanks from some of them for my channel. It seems that some things I did unintentionally have created some value for others. I&rsquo;m surprised and will continue to persist in outputting.</p>
<h3 id="github">GitHub</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/yu_2022_review_github_data.png" alt="yu_2022_review_github_data"></p>
<p>I only started using GitHub properly in the middle of the year. In 2022, I had 1.1k code commits, contributed 36 PRs to 12 projects, and gained 260 followers. What made me happiest was submitting some PRs for optimizations and new features to the hugo theme project I had been using for several years. After some communication with the developers, it was merged into the main branch. There&rsquo;s a curious sense of participation, perhaps this is the charm of open source.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/yu_2022_review_yu_tools.png" alt="yu_2022_review_yu_tools"></p>
<p>My toolbox project &ldquo;GitHub - yu-tools&rdquo; also earned me 400+ stars (don&rsquo;t scold me, it&rsquo;s a markdown project). Along with some blockchain-related projects I did, my total stars finally broke 500, which I&rsquo;m quite happy about. In the new year, I&rsquo;ll write a website for this toolbox project, presenting more tool introductions and user experiences.</p>
<h3 id="sspai">Sspai</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/yu_2022_review_sspai.png" alt="yu_2022_review_sspai"></p>
<p>Sspai is a platform I&rsquo;ve been reading for several years. It has many high-quality articles about productivity tools. I actually didn&rsquo;t expect to become a resident author. This year, I wrote 12 articles (including a few that were moved from my blog), totaling 38,660 words. I received 7 recommendations, including 4 homepage recommendations and 1 member-exclusive. The total reading volume of the articles reached 200k+, and I gained about 150 followers, as well as a few thousand in remuneration. In the new year, I will continue to produce some articles. The cat food is secured (I&rsquo;ve really become a working warrior for the sake of raising a cat). I&rsquo;m very grateful to the editor of Sspai, &ldquo;Bei Xiao&rdquo;, who is very patient and friendly. I also learned some experiences about Shuangpin input method from him.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I experienced a lot in 2022. Even with these records and data, it still feels somewhat surreal when I look back.</p>
<p>A new year is about to begin. I wish myself in 2023, happiness.</p>

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>This piece is a record and reflection of my life from December 20, 2022 to December 27, 2022.</p>
<p>Unconsciously, this is already the 24th article, and the last weekly review of 2022. Sometimes there&rsquo;s this inexplicable sense of ceremony when meaningful events occur at rather round time points, which often makes one particularly happy.</p>
<p>Sometimes the desire to share is just so wondrous. Although I had grown accustomed to closing my Moments entry for nearly four or five years and rarely posted anything related to personal emotions, in the past half year, I began to record my daily life through weekly reports and frequently share on Twitter and Instagram (although mostly cat-related, it&rsquo;s still the first step in recovering from social phobia). Sometimes change doesn&rsquo;t need too many reasons to occur, it&rsquo;s just about timing.</p>
<p>This week I was still shuttling between learning and working, but perhaps due to severe lack of sleep in the previous few days (basically sleeping after 3 AM), efficiency wasn&rsquo;t very high. Most of the time was spent watching courses and debugging code, which also allowed me to slowly adjust my pace.</p>
<p>I spent my first Christmas at home with my cat. I received Christmas decorations for Nini sent by a friend but was too lazy to take photos on the day. I&rsquo;ll release them together with the year-end photos (still on the SD card). On that day, I also ordered Fat Brother&rsquo;s Crab Pot takeout, which I had been missing for quite a while, as a bit of a ritual. But perhaps due to long-term fasting and eating only one meal a day, my appetite has decreased severely, and I couldn&rsquo;t finish it even in two meals.</p>
<p>A college classmate whom I hadn&rsquo;t contacted for a long time recently became a streamer on Bilibili. Suddenly, I felt my otaku attributes were awakened. I watched a few streams and was entrusted to be a righteous room manager and information teacher (?) in the fan group, which was quite interesting. By the way, I researched the recording tool and found a server to run a Docker service for automatic screen recording. It feels quite fun to be able to solve friends&rsquo; problems with some familiar technologies.</p>
<p>Also, it&rsquo;s snowing on my blog.</p>
<h2 id="love-actually">Love Actually</h2>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/loveactually.jpg" alt="loveactually"></p>
<p>Although it&rsquo;s hard for me to contemplate how much longing and courage I still have for love, with the person I once thought I could spend the rest of my life with quietly leaving, traces of life being erased bit by bit, it&rsquo;s inevitable to doubt whether True Love exists when memories resurface. So on Christmas night, I revisited the classic &ldquo;Love Actually&rdquo;, which is also an annual tradition.</p>
<p>This is a movie that always makes me willing to continue believing in beauty no matter how painful a moment I&rsquo;m in. This movie and Matt Cab&rsquo;s English cover of &ldquo;Christmas Song&rdquo; (theme song of the Japanese drama &ldquo;From Five to Nine&rdquo;) always connect Christmas with beautiful love for me. It&rsquo;s not about specific emotions or experiences, just this beautiful atmosphere is enough to express all sentiments.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/love_actually_you_are_perfect.jpg" alt="love_actually_you_are_perfect"></p>
<p>My favorite is this couple. Although there&rsquo;s only love hidden in the heart, it&rsquo;s sincere and beautiful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love you, it has nothing to do with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite rare (or perhaps childish) to retain so many fantasies at this age, but I always feel that the sentiment of liking is far above other factors. I still insist on this after all these experiences.</p>
<p>As I write, I can&rsquo;t help but feel some emotions. I don&rsquo;t want to talk too much, so I&rsquo;ll share some lyrics.</p>
<p>[Lyrics omitted to avoid copyright concerns]</p>
<h2 id="daily-life-with-nini">Daily Life with &ldquo;Nini&rdquo;</h2>
<p>The previous batch of photos and Christmas ones haven&rsquo;t been developed yet, so I&rsquo;ll just share some quiet daily moments.</p>

<p>This section will record some of my input and output, as well as other things I find interesting.</p>
<h3 id="output">Output</h3>
<p>In last week&rsquo;s report, I wrote an article about how to learn, which is a summary and reflection of some of my experiences. I&rsquo;m quite happy about it, and I also posted it on Sspai. I&rsquo;ll continue to work several jobs to earn cat food money, haha.</p>
<p>Although I don&rsquo;t want to start setting various New Year&rsquo;s resolutions so early, I need to continue updating articles!</p>
<h3 id="input">Input</h3>
<h4 id="anime">Anime</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Heaven Official&rsquo;s Blessing</strong>, this one is quite interesting. I rarely watch Chinese animation and similar subjects, but my sister, who just started junior high school this year, began writing fan fiction for Heaven Official&rsquo;s Blessing. Although I&rsquo;ve finished watching each episode, I haven&rsquo;t watched the animation yet. It&rsquo;s also interesting to understand my sister&rsquo;s preferences and the world she focuses on in this way.</li>
<li><strong>Death Note: Desu nôto</strong>, the Death Note anime is unbeatable, but I just like it so much that I&rsquo;ll watch various derivative works even if I might be disappointed. But the series is surprisingly good, focusing a lot on Light&rsquo;s psychological portrayal and changes.</li>
<li><strong>Spy x Family</strong>, I didn&rsquo;t follow part 2 when it started airing, and only caught up these days. Anya is the best!</li>
<li><strong>The Three-Body Problem</strong>, the fourth episode was a bit confusing, stretching a plot that could be told in a few sentences into an entire episode.</li>

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>This is a record and reflection of my life from December 14 to December 19, 2022.</p>
<p>This week I continued working from home due to the pandemic (I feel like I can remove this opening line soon, as it has become the norm). I&rsquo;m still &ldquo;slacking off&rdquo; by learning front-end development, while occasionally writing some back-end code for work. On some days, I didn&rsquo;t even realize dawn had broken. It feels like I&rsquo;ve regained the state I was in last year when I was rushing to meet deadlines and preparing for final exams in Hong Kong. But this time, there&rsquo;s much less external pressure and anxiety. I&rsquo;m enjoying it more.</p>
<p>After experiencing late-night overtime work every day for a while, I&rsquo;ve come to realize how precious it is to have some free time to learn what I want to learn, or simply spend time with my cat. However, I feel like it&rsquo;s been a long time since I&rsquo;ve written about anything substantial or shared my experiences. I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time adjusting my state of mind and sharing my daily life. So today, I&rsquo;d like to share some of my learning experiences, methods, and thoughts. It might be more conceptual, but I&rsquo;ll (probably?) share more specific details in the future.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I decided to add the following two paragraphs after some thought.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually, I initially thought about writing my annual review. So I looked back at my articles from this year (or more accurately, the half year since I resumed updating in May). Apart from some articles about tools and productivity I posted in May, most of them were weekly reviews - thoughts, ideas, emotions, and ramblings. Although it&rsquo;s mainly a channel for self-expression, I occasionally feel guilty for talking too much about emotions, as if I&rsquo;m using my blog as an outlet. So I thought I should provide some substantial content, which led to this experience sharing. Unexpectedly, it turned out to be nearly 7,000 words.</p>
<p>I will write an annual review, which will cover various events from this year - things lost, things gained, things to be grateful for, and inevitable regrets. Although I hesitated about whether to mention some things again, I decided to face them honestly. After all, everything expires, even canned pineapples. This year too. It&rsquo;s these joys, angers, sorrows, and happiness that have shaped my 2022, and shaped a more complete me.</p>
<p>Then, I&rsquo;ll post it on December 31st, a date that&rsquo;s quite special to me.</p>
<p>Starting from a certain point this year, I began adding a theme song to each article - &ldquo;Us After That&rdquo; by Mayday, a song I really like. Today, I&rsquo;ve changed it to &ldquo;Brand New Day,&rdquo; the theme song from the movie &ldquo;Flying Colors.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve always thought it sounds great and fits this article well.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-learn-a-new-technology">How to Learn a New Technology</h2>
<h3 id="my-journey-of-exploring-learning-methods">My Journey of Exploring Learning Methods</h3>
<h4 id="first-explorations">First Explorations</h4>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t someone who particularly advocated for various learning methodologies in the past. I was quite indifferent to these &ldquo;how-to&rdquo; guides. I couldn&rsquo;t even finish reading &ldquo;How to Read a Book&rdquo; in high school (?) I always felt that this was a very individual matter. Many posts I read seemed less effective than what I call the somewhat mystical &ldquo;enlightenment&rdquo; that happens at certain stages. Of course, this enlightenment mostly has nothing to do with talent, it&rsquo;s just finding some of your own ways through exploration.</p>
<p>The change occurred during a high school visit to a bookstore, where I encountered some Zhejiang University students selling their self-compiled and printed college entrance exam preparation materials and experiences. Out of curiosity, I bought a history subject guide. When I had some free time, I flipped through it. It contained some timeline arrangements and memory tricks. Later, when I actually learned this knowledge, I often found it easier to apply. Eventually, history became a subject where I could often rank among the top in my grade, and I gradually developed an interest in studying history (I even considered applying for a history major at one point).</p>
<p>Looking back now, the content of that book itself might not have had any unique parts. The knowledge was just that knowledge. But from the perspective of a college student who had gone through the college entrance exam and achieved good results, the methods were summarized in a way that had a kind of &ldquo;dimensional reduction strike&rdquo; effect. This inspired me to gradually explore my own methods in learning other subjects as well.</p>
<h4 id="learning-mindset">Learning Mindset</h4>
<p>This article doesn&rsquo;t intend to (mainly because I can&rsquo;t explain it clearly) introduce various learning methods with theoretical foundations. There are many videos and articles about &ldquo;XX Learning Method&rdquo;, which might not be as effective as reading the original text after some summary and internalization. Here, I&rsquo;d like to recommend this article <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/read/cv6209820">&ldquo;How do I learn a new technology or knowledge? WW Learning Method? Taking blockchain as an example.&rdquo;</a> by senior <a href="https://space.bilibili.com/43276908">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Luotuo&rdquo;</a>. I benefited a lot from it when I first started learning blockchain and many other subjects.</p>
<p>This time, I want to talk more about my thoughts and experiences on a point that I think is very important but often overlooked - learning mindset.</p>
<p>I was assigned to the English major in university. After only about half a semester, I realized very clearly that this was not a major that I would continue to be passionate about or could rely on for a living. But at that time, I didn&rsquo;t have a very clear goal, so I started learning various skills non-stop to alleviate my confusion and anxiety.</p>
<p>Because I was mainly responsible for some &ldquo;technical&rdquo; related work tasks in the student association, of course, the technology here mainly refers to skills such as graphic design, photography, and video editing. I still remember that my first major project responsibility was a rushed promotional video/MV task for an evening party. As I recall, it wasn&rsquo;t complicated and didn&rsquo;t have any special effects, just some basic processing, splicing, and exporting of video materials, at most adapting to different screen sizes to achieve a good display effect.</p>
<p>So on a weekend, I downloaded Adobe Premiere Pro (commonly known as PR, a software that has tortured me for five or six years, and I didn&rsquo;t expect that many of my future endeavors would be related to video editing, which is also an interesting coincidence), watched some tutorials, and finished it in two days. When I went to submit the task, the club members including the department head were quite surprised and asked if I had learned it before, and how I did it so quickly.</p>
<p>In fact, my understanding of video shooting and editing was limited to making a birthday greeting video in my senior year of high school, and even that was done with the help of a friend (I think we used Huisheng Huiying or Aicijie, which are now distant terms. Interestingly, that friend is now working as a director and editor, another interesting coincidence * 2). When using PR, I subconsciously didn&rsquo;t feel that it was a very difficult software or that editing was a very difficult thing. Learning came naturally, and I could look up any problems I encountered on the spot. There wasn&rsquo;t much technical content, I just went and learned it, that&rsquo;s all.</p>
<p>Many friends might have an instinctive sense of fear when they first start learning something they don&rsquo;t understand, thinking it&rsquo;s very complex. They set up psychological barriers for themselves, and end up never having the determination to learn. Later, when I was teaching in departments and student associations, I often used a basic practical project to help everyone understand that this is not such an &ldquo;unattainable&rdquo; thing. After breaking through this psychological factor and adjusting the learning mindset, learning the operation itself became very easy, and the effect was very good.</p>
<p>Of course, these are just some general skills. The actual programming-related technologies are very different, but the changes in mindset in this aspect might be a long story. Since I&rsquo;m often asked about it, I might as well briefly mention my journey from liberal arts to coding.</p>
<h3 id="my-journey-from-liberal-arts-to-coding">My Journey from Liberal Arts to Coding</h3>
<h4 id="vb-introduction">VB Introduction</h4>
<p>As a liberal arts college in a science and engineering university, we had a very characteristic requirement to study computer science, but it was just the basic VB (Visual Basic) language. Thanks to the academic proficiency test in Zhejiang, which required VB practical exams for the information technology subject, I already had some basic understanding in high school. So learning it again was relatively easy. Although I needed to relearn the syntax, I still felt that it wasn&rsquo;t such a difficult thing in terms of mindset.</p>
<p>At that time, many of my friends were encountering programming languages for the first time and had a very strong fear of syntax and various symbols. So when I was learning, I organized a set of notes of several dozen pages based on my own thoughts and explanations, turning a book into a thin stack of several dozen pages of paper. My friends experienced a big change in their learning mindset, and it was very effective (later it was &ldquo;inherited&rdquo; by the next grade, and the experience of becoming a legendary senior&rsquo;s treasure trove was also a very happy thing).</p>
<h4 id="changing-direction">Changing Direction</h4>
<p>After revisiting VB, I suddenly felt that I really liked the feeling of being able to create and implement some ideas through code, and I felt that I was somewhat &ldquo;good at it&rdquo; to some extent. Thus, I had an idea that seemed a bit bold at the time - &ldquo;Maybe I can make computer science my future direction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course, due to the school&rsquo;s inexplicable rule that &ldquo;liberal arts students recruited through the college entrance exam cannot transfer to science and engineering majors&rdquo;, the path of changing majors was already blocked. The application for a computer science minor at Wuhan University also fell through because my GPA was a bit short.</p>
<p>Well then, I&rsquo;ll just learn it by myself.</p>
<p>So I asked a friend who was minoring in computer science at HUST for their course schedule and textbooks. My mindset at the time was simple: I might not have enough time and energy to catch up with many courses in the major through self-study, but the workload of minor courses was acceptable. So, while supplementing basic courses like operating systems and computer networks, I started learning Python (yes, I also started with Mr. Liao Xuefeng&rsquo;s Python course), and began my journey of &ldquo;not minding my own business&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 id="difficult-progress">Difficult Progress</h4>
<p><del>There were countless nights of struggle and feeling like I was useless and wanted to give up</del>, and during the struggle period, I did various internships/part-time jobs such as running WeChat public accounts, product manager, blockchain game planner, graphic designer, etc., and later registered a company and opened a studio to do video editing, etc. This is mentioned in another article <a href="https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2022/11/17/weekly_review_20221117/">&ldquo;Weekly Review #19 - Remembering an Entrepreneurial Experience&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>I really walked this path with many ups and downs for those few years. There were times when I blindly learned various languages (<del>because I thought it sounded cool to say I knew some niche languages</del>), times when I gave up learning boring basic knowledge to write Web and mini programs (<del>because I could earn extra money</del>), times when I had the misconception that I could write good code without needing to understand various underlying principles and data structures, times when I studied for a long time but seemed to make little progress during bottleneck periods. Of course, there were also many happy gains, but these are already daily occurrences, so I won&rsquo;t list them in detail.</p>
<p>Later, out of career planning considerations (honestly speaking, it&rsquo;s indeed a reality that most English major undergraduates can&rsquo;t even submit their resumes for a technical job in the current environment, an unfortunate but unavoidable situation) and the desire to have some achievements in a specific field, I took a gap year after graduation to apply for a computer science master&rsquo;s degree in Hong Kong. This part is mentioned in <a href="https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2020/06/06/yearly_review_23/">&ldquo;A 23-year-old&rsquo;s Confession: Pursuing Meaning&rdquo;</a>. It was also a way to fulfill one of my dreams (<del>you don&rsquo;t want me, I deserve better than you</del>) after the big disappointment of receiving an invitation from a blockchain professor&rsquo;s lab at National Taiwan University but then being ghosted.</p>
<h4 id="adjusting-mindset">Adjusting Mindset</h4>
<p>In fact, what benefited me most in my subsequent learning was that I never used &ldquo;I am an English major student&rdquo; as an excuse for not learning well. After all, there are no longer high barriers to knowledge acquisition now. I can learn the same knowledge that others can learn from many open courses and tutorials. I even have some freedom to choose, allowing me to find the best and most suitable courses to study. As a result, I&rsquo;ve taken many open courses from MIT and Coursera.</p>
<p>Even when I actually attended the interview for the Computer Science Department at the University of Hong Kong, I didn&rsquo;t avoid talking about my original major as a weakness. Instead, I mentioned the efforts I had made and the results I had achieved as a student from an unrelated major for a major I loved, including some explorations and ideas about the major and the industry. I believe this also helped with the final offer.</p>
<h4 id="the-shelved-liberal-arts-to-coding-guide">The Shelved Liberal Arts to Coding Guide</h4>
<p>As an aside, I&rsquo;ve always wanted to write a guide about transitioning from liberal arts to coding, probably called something like &ldquo;Programming Introduction/Coding Guide for Liberal Arts Students&rdquo; (although it sounds like a marketing Python ad). But I always felt that it would just be some tutorial recommendations and application experiences, and the final result had a large element of luck. Sharing it might not provide much substantial content, and might even seem like a kind of &ldquo;boasting&rdquo; due to survivorship bias, so I never started writing.</p>
<p>But now, after more than a year of work and exploratory learning, I&rsquo;ve managed to somewhat establish myself in the programmer profession or the blockchain industry. I also feel that I have some small experiences in learning new technologies/knowledge, so I plan to restart this idea. I&rsquo;m digging a small pit here, to be filled gradually.</p>
<p>But actually, the intention of doing this is not to tout how good it is to switch to coding or how easy this thing is. The industry does have some advantages, but the hardships and bitterness of switching to coding and learning technology are not few. There are many sleepless nights and many moments of self-doubt, just not worth mentioning. And ultimately, it still relies on bit by bit accumulation, just like that simple yet very real truth - &ldquo;Nothing else, just practice makes perfect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also seen many admired tech experts on Podcasts and Twitter, including those who switched to coding. In comparison, my abilities are not yet sufficient to teach others anything, but I want to write these things down just to convey my thoughts and journey, and maybe to some extent, prevent those who are curious about this field from being deterred by mindset issues.</p>
<p>Those with relevant experiences and insights are welcome to contribute together.</p>
<h3 id="how-i-learn">How I Learn</h3>
<p>Back to the main topic, let me briefly talk about my basic mode of learning a new technology or approaching a new field. This is purely personal experience sharing.</p>
<h4 id="information-source-collection">Information Source Collection</h4>
<p>Perhaps due to some influence from my previous learning mode and personal information control characteristics, I am very inclined to collect many information sources when learning a new technology/knowledge. Compared to some search engine and algorithm-recommended results, I&rsquo;m more accustomed to searching through the historical videos/articles of some favorite YouTubers or personal bloggers. There are often unexpected pleasant surprises (mainly because those experts are too strong and have too wide a range of knowledge, many bloggers I used to watch for Python and Go have updated with very high-quality blockchain content). From their videos/articles, I can see the pitfalls in learning, as well as the practical applications behind this technology.</p>
<p>For example, in the blog of Twitter friend <a href="https://twitter.com/strrlthedev">&ldquo;STRRL&rdquo;</a> <a href="https://strrl.dev/">&ldquo;strrl.dev&rdquo;</a>, I can see many small toys he&rsquo;s tinkered with, some of which are things I have the same need for but didn&rsquo;t think of (<del>or couldn&rsquo;t</del>) implementing in this way, which can be very inspiring. And when watching the blog of another Twitter friend <a href="https://twitter.com/n0vad3v">&ldquo;Nova Kwok&rdquo;</a> <a href="https://nova.moe/">&ldquo;Nova Kwok&rsquo;s Awesome Blog&rdquo;</a>, I often find myself thinking, &ldquo;How does this person know everything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In addition to specific knowledge and tutorials, I can also see from them the kind of person I aspire to become, having more curiosity and desire to explore, and having more expectations for the future.</p>
<h4 id="initial-understanding">Initial Understanding</h4>
<p>In terms of choosing tutorials, I&rsquo;ve mentioned before that I like to start with a Crash Course approach. Directly translated as &ldquo;Learn XXX in XX Hours&rdquo; might sound a bit like clickbait, but there are really many such series on YouTube. Just search for something like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=next.js+crash+course+2022">&ldquo;Next.js Crash Course 2022&rdquo;</a> and you&rsquo;ll get many interesting results.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/nextjs_crash_course.png" alt="nextjs_crash_course"></p>
<p>When I was making a ÐApp Demo a while ago, I used Next.js for basic front-end display, so I watched this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTz0GXj8NN0">Next.js Crash Course</a> by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TraversyMedia">Traversy Media</a> from the search results. I really like his way of explaining, in just one hour it gave me a basic understanding of this framework including the entire front-end development language. Although I couldn&rsquo;t start a project on my own without systematic learning, when I later saw some syntax appearing in the front-end code of the project, I could understand what it was doing. It was also easier to make some of my own customized modifications based on someone else&rsquo;s framework.</p>
<p>For example, this is my personal homepage <a href="https://home.pseudoyu.com/">&ldquo;Yu - Homepage&rdquo;</a> that I modified based on a project <a href="https://github.com/craftzdog/craftzdog-homepage">&ldquo;GitHub - craftzdog/craftzdog-homepage&rdquo;</a> open-sourced by another YouTuber I really like, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@devaslife">devaslife</a>, after watching the Next.js Crash Course. It&rsquo;s possible to create a beautiful small project in a very short time, which is also a great motivation when starting to learn a new technology.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/yu_homepage_profile.png" alt="yu_homepage_profile"></p>
<h4 id="in-depth-learning">In-depth Learning</h4>
<p>But to write some enterprise-level projects or to make a complex project from scratch on your own, relying solely on Crash Courses is far from enough. More systematic learning and practice with many projects will be needed. At this point, some more practical courses are needed, which depends on personal preference. Many Crash Course authors actually have their own boot camps or paid tutorials. If you find a blogger whose style and format you like, you can continue learning with them.</p>
<p>I personally prefer the <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a> platform, which is a relatively established online course website. Although the prices look ridiculous, they&rsquo;re basically always on sale, always sending out discount coupons for various reasons, <del>making me always worry that it might go bankrupt one day</del>. On average, a course costs about $9.99-$12.99, which is less than 100 RMB, which is still very worthwhile.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TraversyMedia">Brad Traversy</a> I mentioned above has opened courses on React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, etc. on Udemy. Because I really like his project-oriented approach and his teaching style, even though there are courses on Udemy with much higher purchases/ratings than his, I still chose his. These are some of the Web-related courses I purchased (many were purchased at promotional prices in the past two days, haven&rsquo;t started watching yet).</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/udemy_web_course.png" alt="udemy_web_course"></p>
<h4 id="output-resultsproject-practice">Output Results/Project Practice</h4>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked with my leader before about learning methods. When he learns a new language/framework, he first explores on his own to get the project running, tries to change some things himself, and then might directly use it in the project, solving problems one by one as they arise. This is a very efficient way to master something, and it might be more universally applicable in project engineering applications. But I might still be a bit more academic-oriented. I would choose to watch courses/tutorials, which might be relatively less efficient at first, but can master some best practices from the beginning, and be more stable mentally when encountering problems later.</p>
<p><del>Inner monologue: If I had my leader&rsquo;s terrifying engineering ability to discover a framework the night before and restructure the project framework the next day, why would I watch any courses?</del></p>
<p>Watching courses also gives a sense of achievement in completing assignments, practicing projects, and finally completing the course, which can give oneself some motivation at various stages of learning. For example, I completed a React course in a little over a week, got the certificate, and successfully used it in an actual Side Project. It&rsquo;s quite encouraging to continue.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/udemy_react_cert.jpg" alt="udemy_react_cert"></p>
<p>Of course, this method still has a threshold, which is that many of these high-quality courses are still on YouTube or some foreign platforms, basically only in English. So there&rsquo;s still some need to overcome this, although they usually provide Chinese subtitles. But I personally still prefer to watch in English, after all, it also involves a lot of terminology, and machine translation is generally not very good.</p>
<p>In addition, because courses usually have a relatively long cycle, it&rsquo;s easy to give up halfway or procrastinate until you forget the previous content. Without practice or recording, it&rsquo;s easy to forget. To overcome this, I adopted two simple yet effective methods - output-oriented and result-oriented learning.</p>
<p>Output orientation is easy to understand. I update my personal blog, <del>which used to have a lot of technical content, now swinging back and forth between daily blogger and tool efficiency blogger</del>. When I&rsquo;m learning a technology/knowledge, I split the screen and record key notes in Logseq. Note that this must not be directly pasting course materials, but more of typing it out in the editor and adding annotations diligently. Meanwhile, I directly screenshot and save key things like commands or code snippets. After completion, I digest the notes for a period of time.</p>
<p>After 1-2 weeks, I look at the notes again and organize them into an article. There are two very important points here. One is the 1-2 week period. When we just finish learning, we have a relatively deep impression, and often have an illusion of &ldquo;I already know it&rdquo;, but in fact, we may not have mastered it very solidly. It might just be some immediate memory. 1-2 weeks is just a good digestion period. Organizing into an article is another crucial point. We often write some scattered notes or mind maps, but actually being able to organize a knowledge point into an article, expressing it in natural language, making it flow smoothly for readers, is quite challenging.</p>
<p>At this point, those annotations and screenshots from earlier come in handy. When I&rsquo;m writing articles, I have a habit of dialoguing with myself and repeatedly reviewing. That is, after writing a module, I often ask myself, if I were the reader, what questions would I ask here, how should I answer them. In fact, I often find some points that are not explained clearly enough. With the supplementary explanations added after repeated review, by the time of writing, it&rsquo;s generally a technical blog post that is complete in writing and conforms to my own thinking logic. It&rsquo;s much more effective as a reference for future review or as a reference document than looking at someone else&rsquo;s materials.</p>
<p>Actually, a better way is to record a video explanation. Being able to explain something clearly in a video is even more challenging than writing it clearly, but I&rsquo;m still overcoming some psychological barriers to recording video lectures.</p>
<p>One of my small goals for next year is to become a tech YouTuber/up主, <del>maybe I&rsquo;ll end up becoming a pet blogger, after all, who would watch me? Those who open the weekly review are all here to see Nini, right? I won&rsquo;t post today, I&rsquo;ll save it for the year-end summary to get a wave of views</del>.</p>
<p>In addition to output, I have another extreme operation that I don&rsquo;t recommend everyone to try lightly - result-oriented learning. It&rsquo;s actually about taking on tasks that are beyond your current ability (but not too much), using results and deadlines to force yourself to quickly master, and to try harder to solve problems when encountered.</p>
<p>This might be related to personal mentality, confidence, and multitasking ability. I&rsquo;m a person who can handle things calmly when encountered, often with several tasks in parallel but not to the point of being overwhelmed. And years of experience in stumbling have taught me a simple truth - even the most complex tasks miraculously get done in the few minutes before the deadline approaches. Maybe this is the real primary productivity.</p>
<p><del>But now as the projects get more and more complex, I should do this less. What if it fails?</del></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s not much more to say about methods. The above is just some experience sharing about learning a new technology or knowledge. After learning, you might only be able to say you&rsquo;ve just started. There&rsquo;s no shortcut to cultivating engineering ability, it can only be accumulated through continuous practice.</p>
<p>Technology is a very interesting thing, and learning about it at different stages gives completely different feelings. Just like my leader, who is a strong player with more than 20 years of work experience, still often sends me a message in the middle of the night saying, &ldquo;XXX framework/tool is quite interesting, you can play with it&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I really like his way of saying it, &ldquo;play&rdquo; with it. We don&rsquo;t need to struggle or argue about what it&rsquo;s like to turn a hobby into a career, because we already enjoy it. Work is just a by-product that happens to be able to make a living. I hope everyone can find their heart&rsquo;s desire.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not any big shot, and at my current stage, it&rsquo;s difficult to write very in-depth articles on specific technologies and fields (but I&rsquo;m trying hard). So I wanted to share some of my various experiences. Later, I also want to output some video tutorials and text tutorials for some more detailed technologies.</p>
<p><del>Let me count how many pits I&rsquo;ve dug today that need to be filled.</del></p>

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>This is a record and reflection of my life from <code>2022-12-07</code> to <code>2022-12-13</code>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been about 20 cumulative days since I last stepped out of my home. Given the current workload of multiple concurrent projects and the almost-cleared negative status, I haven&rsquo;t planned to return to the office yet. I&rsquo;m even considering staying at home until before the new year. The self-quarantine life is quite pleasant.</p>
<p>The busy work and side projects have blurred the line between weekends and workdays. However, years of ingrained habits still give me the illusion that &ldquo;weekends are my own time, isn&rsquo;t it a waste to just sleep?&rdquo; Plus, without the pressure of morning meetings, I&rsquo;ve been staying up later. Nevertheless, I&rsquo;ve done quite a few interesting things, explored some topics I&rsquo;ve always wanted to learn and applied them to projects, and even made some demo toys. I&rsquo;ve been in a rather happy state throughout.</p>
<p>In other moments, I watched the Netherlands match with a close friend in Australia via voice call (though they lost), and learned that I&rsquo;ll receive a delightful gift (although it&rsquo;ll be delivered to Hong Kong, and I can&rsquo;t get it for now). A friend of mine, influenced by me, has also started writing weekly reviews, and we&rsquo;re urging each other to update (though I&rsquo;ve procrastinated for a few days again). My cat now understands her name, and a simple &ldquo;Nie Nie, come here&rdquo; can summon her from any corner of the house, just like a Pokémon. And many other interesting things.</p>
<h2 id="involution-and-anxiety">Involution and Anxiety</h2>
<p>In the latest learning record video by <a href="https://space.bilibili.com/58078997">polebug</a>, I saw a discussion about involution and anxiety. Personally, I&rsquo;m not very fond of the word &ldquo;involution&rdquo;. Calling oneself &ldquo;involuted&rdquo; seems to carry a sense of superiority and self-satisfaction. Hearing others evaluate it this way reminds me of the peculiar feeling I had as a child when teachers would say, &ldquo;This child isn&rsquo;t smart, but he&rsquo;s always hardworking and deserves encouragement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Involution&rdquo; seems to go hand in hand with the pervasive sense of anxiety nowadays, stemming from work project pressures, confusion about one&rsquo;s direction or dissatisfaction with the pace of improvement, and the so-called peer pressure. We tend to place ourselves on the negative side of our current stage, often influenced by certain arguments to deny ourselves, and then squeeze our free time through various forms of self-satisfying efforts, often ending up physically and mentally exhausted.</p>
<p>I prefer the description of &ldquo;<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/today-i-learned-til">TIL</a>&rdquo; that&rsquo;s more commonly mentioned abroad. Today I Learned - beyond completing basic or repetitive work duties, what have you learned? It could be reading some leisure books or reference books, learning a new technology or summarizing previous experiences into writing, starting a new project or optimizing existing ones. As long as it&rsquo;s within the realm of curiosity and thirst for knowledge, it can be called a &ldquo;TIL&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Learning and exploration itself is an interesting thing, and it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have to be directly related to results or benefits. Although it might sound a bit cliché, my limited experience has always led me to believe in a kind of &ldquo;uselessness is useful&rdquo; mindset. Often, things done out of interest, curiosity, or other pure purposes in the past bring surprises at some stage in the future. What we need to do is often just follow our hearts and wait quietly.</p>
<h2 id="daily-life-with-nie-nie">Daily Life with &ldquo;Nie Nie&rdquo;</h2>
<p>This week has been another stay-at-home life together. I can gradually feel the trust and emotional dependency being built (and she&rsquo;s also become much more unrestrained). She would quietly sleep in front of the keyboard amid the noisy voices and keyboard clicks while I&rsquo;m busy in various meetings. When I haven&rsquo;t paid attention to her for a long time, she would circle around my feet, craving for a hug. She would watch the World Cup with me, focusing on the movements on the field. She would parkour into my blanket before sleep, and even step on my face to &ldquo;wake&rdquo; me up when I&rsquo;m reluctant to get out of bed to change her food.</p>

<p>This section will record my input and output, as well as other things I find interesting.</p>
<h3 id="technology">Technology</h3>
<p>Due to the needs of a side project, I properly studied React this week, following some courses I had previously bought on Udemy. I feel that front-end development is quite interesting now. When I was in college, I earned some extra money by writing websites. I remember at that time, I was cobbling together HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on my own. I think I used jQuery to get elements or something. I remember using ThinkPHP then, and there was some MVC framework. Even the WeChat mini-program I made later feels like a relic of the past now.</p>
<p>Because I haven&rsquo;t written front-end for a long time and don&rsquo;t have much technological baggage, I used JavaScript + React + TailWind CSS + daisyUI to cobble together a demo practice project &ldquo;GitHub Finder&rdquo; for finding GitHub users and repos. I feel that there are now many more tool chains and libraries for writing front-end. I barely wrote any CSS for the entire project, and the mobile responsiveness is pretty good too. It&rsquo;s quite comfortable.</p>
<p>However, the project I need to use later requires TypeScript + Next.js + TailWind CSS, so this demo is just for building a foundation.</p>
<p>Interestingly, after writing a lot of JavaScript these two weeks, the other day when I was screen sharing with a small leader in my work to modify Go code, I instinctively used <code>.length</code> to get the length of an array. It took me a while to realize after it reported an error. I could feel the confusion from the other side of the screen, as if I had forgotten how to write Go after just a few days away from it, haha.</p>
<p>I feel like I&rsquo;m getting closer and closer to being able to cobble together some interesting little tools. I&rsquo;m happy about that.</p>
<h3 id="input">Input</h3>
<h4 id="anime">Anime</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Three-Body Problem</strong>, I had been looking forward to the animated version of The Three-Body Problem for a while. Two episodes have been released. I personally have read about half of the original novel, but I&rsquo;m not a big fan and don&rsquo;t have much &ldquo;faith&rdquo; in it. Overall, I think it&rsquo;s pretty good. The visuals and pacing are decent.</li>

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>This is a record and reflection of my life from <code>2022-11-28</code> to <code>2022-12-06</code>.</p>
<p>They say it takes 21 days to form a habit, yet by the 21st weekly review, I still haven&rsquo;t managed to update on schedule. Each week brings a creative excuse for the delay.</p>
<p>The past week wasn&rsquo;t particularly busy work-wise, with features developed for events successfully launched and entering the routine maintenance phase. However, my sleep patterns remained concerning, with bedtime still mostly after 3 AM. The project I mentioned earlier, undertaken with a junior, is well-prepared and gradually launching. It feels more like I&rsquo;m busy with things I enjoy, so it&rsquo;s a happy burden. But with things piling up here and there, even someone accustomed to multitasking like myself often feels overwhelmed. Fortunately, my physical health seems fine.</p>
<p>Still working remotely from home due to the pandemic (it&rsquo;s been exactly 15 days since I last went out), continuing to spend time with Nie Nie. In contrast to a previous weekly review theme &ldquo;<a href="https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2022/10/09/weekly_review_20221009/">Life and Self Put on Hold</a>&rdquo;, my life seems to have been picked up again, filled with many bright moments.</p>
<h2 id="life-picked-up-again">Life Picked Up Again</h2>
<p>Even though I hadn&rsquo;t really noticed it myself, in the 40 days since bringing Nie Nie home, I&rsquo;ve undergone many changes. Due to being busy with work recently, I hadn&rsquo;t been in touch with a friend for over a month. This time, I happened to help solve a computer issue, and we chatted briefly, resulting in the following conversation:</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/chat_with_jmadeinapril.png" alt="chat_with_jmadeinapril"></p>
<p>Although it&rsquo;s not as dramatic as the melancholic temperament mentioned, I am generally not a particularly positive or sunny person. I have a sense of detachment from life and many things. It&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t care or can&rsquo;t empathize, but I don&rsquo;t have such strong emotional investment. It&rsquo;s like a role-playing game where I&rsquo;m playing myself. In conversations with others, I don&rsquo;t tend to reveal much of my inner self. Again, it&rsquo;s not due to distrust or deliberate concealment to create some persona, I&rsquo;m just not accustomed to it.</p>
<p>Now, even though I don&rsquo;t seem to have consciously changed anything, people can sense emotions even in casual conversations. It&rsquo;s a kind of satisfaction and fullness that gradually overflows from my words. Although the decision to adopt a cat again involved repeated consideration and weighing of options, I never imagined it would be something that would change me so much. Beyond being a pet and a roommate with responsibilities and concerns, she has become an inseparable part of my life.</p>
<p>While chatting with another close friend, I was asked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;After getting Nie Nie, will you become more content with your current life and unwilling to make any changes?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My perception is actually quite the opposite. Recently, I&rsquo;ve been more frequently and proactively re-planning my life rhythm and future goals, including future work forms, locations, and content. It seems that for the previous me, as long as I was doing what I liked and was with people I cared about, it was satisfying enough, regardless of which city I was in or what kind of work I was doing. Other things didn&rsquo;t matter much. Now, I&rsquo;m gradually finding a more comfortable state and mode of life in my solitude and &ldquo;idle time&rdquo; with Nie Nie. I&rsquo;m also more concerned with the meaning of life itself. Life is not just an appendage to my hobbies and work, but a precious existence that deserves respect and exploration in its own right.</p>
<p>Although I don&rsquo;t want to sound too profound, Nie Nie seems like a sudden redemption appearing in the gloomy moments of my life. I&rsquo;ve invested too many emotions and feelings in caring for her. So, I actually have more expectations for the future life we&rsquo;ll spend together. At the very least, I&rsquo;ll work harder to earn money for cat food and strive for more control over my time to provide more companionship.</p>
<h2 id="daily-life-with-nie-nie">Daily Life with &ldquo;Nie Nie&rdquo;</h2>
<p>I watched a documentary before, &ldquo;The Secret Life of Cats&rdquo;, which interprets cats&rsquo; behaviors and the thoughts behind them. Recently, I seem to have developed a similar tendency. In some interesting moments of life, I would take a photo and caption it with my interpretation of cat language. It&rsquo;s a very interesting experience, as if both cats and humans are trying to guess each other&rsquo;s thoughts.</p>
<p>Because her eye secretions were quite heavy, I consulted a doctor who said it might be due to excessive protein intake. So I started changing her food and reducing some treats. On the first day, when she found that her meals weren&rsquo;t as lavish as before, she kept lying on my computer and looking at me with the expression in the picture below.</p>

<h2 id="others">Others</h2>
<p>This section will record my input and output, as well as other things I find interesting.</p>
<h3 id="output">Output</h3>
<p>I realized it&rsquo;s been a long time since I wrote a proper technical blog. Actually, I&rsquo;ve drafted and taken notes on many topics, but haven&rsquo;t organized them into articles yet. I need to speed up my output. However, recently I&rsquo;ve been translating the &ldquo;<a href="https://gocn.github.io/styleguide/">Google Go Style Guide</a>&rdquo; with my colleagues from GoCN. Along with the previously translated &ldquo;<a href="https://gocn.github.io/How-To-Code-in-Go/">How To Code In Go</a>&rdquo;, we&rsquo;ve published online and PDF versions. Today, we even received a collaboration invitation from GeekTime (and incidentally, all team members can get a free column). It&rsquo;s quite a happy little achievement.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/gocn_trans_book.png" alt="gocn_trans_book"></p>
<p>Without realizing it, my Telegram channel &ldquo;<a href="https://t.me/pseudoyulife">Yu&rsquo;s Life</a>&rdquo; just reached 200 subscribers. It&rsquo;s quite amazing actually. It&rsquo;s just a small channel that automatically synchronizes my input and output from various platforms, but it has slowly accumulated some followers. I often receive private messages or friend requests from readers on various platforms, saying that the channel has brought them some different perspectives and thoughts. I&rsquo;m quite honored that a small idea at the time could produce such interesting results. I&rsquo;ve had less input and output in the past few weeks due to being busy with work, but I hope to continue persevering.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/yu_life_tg_subs_100.png" alt="yu_life_tg_subs_100"></p>
<p>Another small hobby this week is teasing ChatGPT. The AI chatbots now are too powerful. While GitHub Copilot might be more helpful in writing some utility methods, ChatGPT can actually write out the entire program (and it correctly understood my intention despite my spelling errors). We might be out of jobs soon.</p>

<h3 id="input">Input</h3>
<h4 id="tv-series">TV Series</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Untamed</strong>, recommended by a friend. I haven&rsquo;t watched much of this genre, so it was quite a pleasant surprise. I binge-watched it over a weekend. Most of the plot holds up to scrutiny, and the characters are all very likable. Xiao Xue Huan and Xi Jun are too cute!</li>
<li><strong>Periphery</strong>, the first few episodes seemed a bit patchwork but the presentation was quite good. It got more chaotic as it went on, lacking both the thrill of something like Ready Player One and any real depth. It ended up being a bit of a flop in the end.</li>
<li><strong>Wednesday</strong>, I forgot where I saw the recommendation. I finished it during work breaks. Apart from the initial setting being relatively novel, it became somewhat confusing later on. It was a bit disappointing, but I still finished it.</li>
<li><strong>Silence of Snow</strong>, currently watching. It focuses on emotional rendering, so the subsequent pace is also slower. I just hope they stop torturing the second male lead.</li>

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>This piece is a record and reflection of my life from November 18 to November 27, 2022.</p>
<p>The weekend has arrived, and for once, I had no concentrated development work. I slept soundly, caught up on some missed episodes in the afternoon, and finally began writing my weekly review. It seems I&rsquo;ve been delaying it for a few days each week, sneakily erasing a week&rsquo;s worth of reviews. We&rsquo;re back to Sunday, and a new cycle begins.</p>
<p>This week has been a devilish schedule. I normally sleep at three or four in the morning and wake up at eight or nine. On two or three days, I didn&rsquo;t sleep until after six in the morning, followed by a full day&rsquo;s work. This cycle repeated itself. However, with my cat&rsquo;s companionship, it wasn&rsquo;t too unbearable. Being at home continuously even fostered a sense of mutual dependence.</p>
<p>Perhaps due to my workaholic and laid-back lifestyle, and coincidentally helping the cool senior I mentioned before to list one of her artworks as an NFT, I took my cat to her place to experience a &ldquo;WeWork + cat cafe&rdquo; setup. I also enjoyed two meals there. It was one of the few leisurely moments this week, and once again, I marveled at the vast difference between our lifestyles and quality of life. But each has its own joys.</p>
<p>As for the cat, it&rsquo;s truly ungrateful. It wasn&rsquo;t shy at all, easily won over by good food and fun things. It curiously explored everywhere and was reluctant to leave. All my efforts wasted. I&rsquo;ll definitely strive to improve our living environment in the future (the realization of a humble cat servant).</p>
<h2 id="the-loss-of-desire-to-consume">The Loss of Desire to Consume</h2>
<p>I used to be someone with a strong desire to consume, more like a repressed retaliatory consumption. Due to family education methods, I never had regular pocket money as a student, nor rewards for good grades (of course, there were no criticisms or punishments for poor performance either, which was fair). Instead, if I needed something, I would tell my parents, and they would buy it directly. It might have been a good model, but it was difficult to propose extra or unnecessary consumption to family members.</p>
<p>I still vividly remember (or perhaps I&rsquo;m still hung up on) a gift I waited half a year for in primary school. I had always thought it would be a GBA SP (the flip-top, backlit GBA handheld, as I always wanted to play Pokemon), but when I received it, it was a remote-controlled helicopter. I was very disappointed at the time. Thinking about it now, it wasn&rsquo;t bad; it gave me some foundation when I later learned about drones.</p>
<p>However, because I couldn&rsquo;t immediately get what I wanted at the time, there was always a suppression of the desire to consume. When I became financially independent in my junior year, I could freely dispose of my own earnings, so I successively bought many things, especially various electronic/digital products. Some weren&rsquo;t really necessities or things I truly wanted; I just enjoyed the feeling of being able to own them freely. I even developed a habit of collecting various packaging boxes (which are still neatly stacked on top of my bookshelf).</p>
<p>After starting work, this tendency intensified. After all, I&rsquo;m in a profession that deals with software and hardware daily. Combined with my love for tinkering with various tools and applications, once I had a certain financial capacity, I started supporting genuine versions. I&rsquo;ve always had significant expenses on electronic devices and software, and I even maintain a relatively popular project called &ldquo;Personal Toolbox - pseudoyu/yu-tools&rdquo;, which is continuously updated. At the same time, I often buy interesting Switch games, although many haven&rsquo;t even been opened yet, and I&rsquo;ve lost much of the mindset to slowly savor them.</p>
<p>I seem to be someone who doesn&rsquo;t hesitate to spend on hobbies and things I like. Compared to these, my daily diet and living arrangements are rather perfunctory. But I feel that in the past six months, my desire to consume has been gradually diminishing. I no longer seem to have that enthusiasm to eagerly await hardware product releases for days, watching reviews and waiting for delivery. Although I often complain that my 16-inch Intel laptop was betrayed by Apple, I don&rsquo;t care so much about the so-called M series and the numbers behind it anymore. It&rsquo;s more like a habit to look at the released parameters and benchmarks, see what improvements have been made, and then say to myself, &ldquo;Oh, okay, maybe next generation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I participated in the Double Eleven shopping festival recently. Since I had just brought the cat home, I bought many related supplies and received packages for several consecutive days. However, when everything was settled and I thought about buying something for myself, I seemed to fall into a kind of blank state. It felt like I didn&rsquo;t lack anything and didn&rsquo;t want anything, so I gave up in the end. Recently, it&rsquo;s also been Black Friday. Like previous years, I opened some tweets and articles to see what software and digital products were on sale. After looking for quite a while, I only ended up buying two courses related to my recent work and a personal subscription to the note-taking software Craft. Most subscriptions are about to expire, but I don&rsquo;t feel much about it. Maybe I&rsquo;ll buy a physical examination package on Double Twelve.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to say whether the decrease in material desire is a good thing or a bad thing. Perhaps it&rsquo;s because I no longer need too many tangible, touchable things to fill my inner needs, and I&rsquo;m slowly turning to some parts that can be internalized. Maybe it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;ve entrusted many of my needs to my cat and some dependent relationships, and I don&rsquo;t have as much energy as before to focus on some momentary satisfactions. Or perhaps in the increasingly saturated work and daily life, I&rsquo;ve gradually lost some curiosity and motivation to explore.</p>
<h2 id="daily-life-with-nie-nie">Daily Life with &ldquo;Nie Nie&rdquo;</h2>
<p>This week was so busy that I didn&rsquo;t read any books, and only caught up on one drama over the weekend. I didn&rsquo;t manage anything else, but I did make time to take Nie Nie for a check-up. There are still some concerning minor issues, and we&rsquo;re continuing with medication treatment. I hope it can always be healthy. I get incredibly worried even about the slightest problems.</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;ve been working from home, I&rsquo;ve had much more time to spend together. There have been many great moments worth recording. I feel like posting several daily updates, like someone obsessed with showing off their child. So I plan to open a small section in the weekly review to record these moments daily. Later, I also want to make something like photo albums to document these precious times.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>First Love</strong>: The taxi driver setting reminds me of previously watched &ldquo;I Remember a Little&rdquo;, &ldquo;Drive My Car&rdquo;, and an anime &ldquo;The Magical Taxi&rdquo;. I think this is truly a profession that can see all aspects of human life. I&rsquo;ve been looking forward to this for quite a while. The development around music, the presentation style of interweaving memories and the present, and Hikari Mitsushima are all attractive points. There were several scene transitions that amazed me. However, in terms of plot, it&rsquo;s hard to say it stands out. But now I&rsquo;m increasingly unable to bear cruelty, so I think this sweet story is quite good. After all, looking at &ldquo;The Quiet Snow&rdquo; playing next door, I feel sorry for the second male and female leads every day. As I get older, I guess I&rsquo;m more suited to sweet love stories. Overall, it&rsquo;s quite worth watching.</li>
<li><strong>The Quiet Snow</strong>: Currently watching. It&rsquo;s really heartbreaking. I&rsquo;ve always been able to empathize more with the second male lead, but he&rsquo;s getting hurt.</li>

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>This is a record and reflection of my life from <code>November 9, 2022</code> to <code>November 17, 2022</code>.</p>
<p>I almost missed this week&rsquo;s review. It&rsquo;s been a long time since I published on time on Sundays (and it&rsquo;s getting later and later). There are always various things happening. I often comfort myself that it&rsquo;s just a record of my life, and I can lower its priority when I&rsquo;m too busy. But occasionally, I find some heartfelt comments in the background, and even on platforms like Weibo that I&rsquo;ve almost abandoned, there are some update requests. This makes me truly feel the connection between the words I write and the readers behind the screen. So every time I open the document, it&rsquo;s hard to be perfunctory. It&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;m pressuring myself to produce some useful content or valuable ideas, but I can&rsquo;t help but imagine if I, as a reader, would be disappointed when opening the weekly review as usual. It&rsquo;s a small standard I set for myself.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always found it hard to call myself an author. The title seems too heavy, as if it creates a gap with the readers. Perhaps I define myself more as a person who writes sincerely, whether it&rsquo;s the ramblings in some weekly review ideas or the digestion and deconstruction of knowledge in technical blog posts. I seem to be very accustomed to presenting many of my thoughts in written form. At its root, it&rsquo;s still a carrier of my desire for self-sharing, but I often gain many unexpected delights, which motivates me to keep going.</p>
<p>Because work has been occupying my time, my input and output this week haven&rsquo;t been much. However, due to some events, I recalled a previous startup experience, which is the first time I&rsquo;ve reviewed it completely.</p>
<h2 id="remembering-a-startup-experience">Remembering a Startup Experience</h2>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/my_cat_nie_nie_02.jpg" alt="my_cat_nie_nie_02"></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been working late nights for over a week now, sleeping around two or three in the morning and struggling to get up for the morning meeting the next day. We&rsquo;ve launched several major requirements. However, I&rsquo;ve been working remotely from home most of the time, occasionally going to the office when I feel like going out. So I&rsquo;ve had a taste of my ideal remote work mode in advance. Plus, with my cat keeping me company, even under high pressure, it&rsquo;s not as painful as last year when I was rushing to deliver the final acceptance on-site.</p>
<p>Moreover, even while rushing the project, I started a side startup project with a junior I met by chance. My initial intention was just to improve my technical skills faster, but it&rsquo;s been an interesting process to gradually shape some small ideas through discussions. I&rsquo;m enjoying it very much.</p>
<p>I also rewatched the TV series &ldquo;Silicon Valley&rdquo; for the third time this week. I guess I&rsquo;m the type who has endless energy (or to some extent, overdrafts it) when I feel I&rsquo;m exploring new fields or learning new knowledge. I seem to find more fun and sense of achievement. I&rsquo;m quite lucky in general, as my work for a living also carries my interests and personal pursuits. Speaking of this, at this stage, I can say with some embarrassment that I once had a startup experience. The result wasn&rsquo;t great, but it&rsquo;s a period I cherish very much.</p>
<p>At the end of my junior year in college, I gritted my teeth and bought a Sony A7M3. The whole set cost over 20,000 yuan, which emptied all my savings at the time. So I hit it off with a teacher from my college, and we came up with the idea of starting an online education video studio.</p>
<p>Things unfolded much more smoothly than I had imagined. We had the initial concept at the end of July, made a business plan (BP) by the end of August, and negotiated cooperation with the college leaders. We quickly obtained a venue that we could use for free, a startup fund that seemed considerable at the time, and some project cooperation opportunities. We established the company in September, and to save money, I even learned and tried to register the company and handle finances myself (which almost backfired when closing the company due to some non-standard tax declaration issues). The following weeks were spent purchasing and setting up studio equipment. In October, we officially started recruiting people and recorded our first course.</p>
<p>Even from today&rsquo;s perspective, it&rsquo;s hard to imagine what kind of ideas and enthusiasm I had when doing this. Market promotion, lighting, shooting, editing, post-production, packaging, and various tedious business presentations and negotiations - to save costs, I did everything alone at first, and later gradually trained a few talented &ldquo;interns&rdquo;. I can&rsquo;t remember how many nights I spent in that soundproof, airtight studio, and the texture of the IKEA sofa bed became an indelible memory point of that period.</p>
<p>After a year of exploration, everything seemed to be taking shape slowly, and the studio was beginning to take form. But as graduation approached, I found it hard to truly regard making videos as my career. Somewhat willfully, I still chose to apply for a master&rsquo;s degree in computer science. So while doing some remote work to maintain my livelihood during my gap year, occasionally traveling back and forth to Wuhan to complete recording projects, I was also preparing for IELTS and application essays. In fact, I had already realized that I might not intend to continue doing this, but I was unwilling to give up my hard work just like that.</p>
<p>This dilemma didn&rsquo;t last too long. The pandemic came, and the studio, based in Wuhan and highly dependent on offline business, naturally came to a standstill. As I went to study in Hong Kong, the time I could squeeze out was only enough to remotely complete some business wrap-up work. So in May 2021, I officially deregistered the company. When I received the final deregistration confirmation, it wasn&rsquo;t really regret I felt. I had tried something in an area within my capabilities, adding some color to my college life. It ended fairly decently too. I distributed the last bit of business income (although not much) to the teachers who participated in the investment and the studio members who were still helping me with many follow-up tasks, drawing a relatively satisfactory end to my entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>Although it was all my own choice, there was still a bit of sadness lingering. In many subsequent summaries, I only mentioned it briefly, as if afraid that once I passed this stage, I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to pick up the courage to do these things again, and then talking about &ldquo;past bravery&rdquo; would lose its meaning. Rather than dwelling on the success or failure of the result, I still feel that that period actively influences my work and life attitude. Although the field and content are vastly different, the belief in persevering to do one thing well, the methodology of problem-solving, the calmness in handling various things in multiple threads, and many, many other qualities seem to have been left from that time. I&rsquo;m also glad that I can still follow my heart to try some things now.</p>
<h2 id="nie-nie-and-a-healing-life">&ldquo;Nie Nie&rdquo; and a Healing Life</h2>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t officially named her yet. It always feels like something that needs to be decided very solemnly, and I haven&rsquo;t had any ideas yet. But recently, she&rsquo;s gotten a nickname &ldquo;Nie Nie&rdquo;, a cute onomatopoeia. I guess there will be some daily records in every weekly review from now on. I&rsquo;ve also started to organize my camera on weekends, beginning to record some growth. Who knows, maybe I could become a vlogger or a cute pet blogger (? dreaming). But I was indeed inspired by the video diaries of <a href="https://space.bilibili.com/58078997">polebug</a> that I saw on Bilibili, which sparked the idea of video recording. Anyway, there are still many things I want to do, let&rsquo;s start bit by bit.</p>
<p>When chatting with a friend this week, I was suddenly commented that my life seems quite healing. I suddenly realized that it&rsquo;s been a long time since I&rsquo;ve been told this. I always immerse myself in some emotions, or fill my time with some internal or external busyness. But in these two weeks with Nie Nie&rsquo;s company, I seem to have become a baby-showing maniac and a dad. The whole world seems to have brightened up, along with my life.</p>
<p>Maybe because I spoil her too much, she often comes to make mischief when I&rsquo;m working, and has also fallen in love with climbing on my keyboard and computer, making me completely unable to focus on work, haha.</p>

<li><strong>My Profession is a Novelist</strong>, currently reading. Murakami is really a unique writer. I love his writing style and expression so much.</li>

<li><strong>Silicon Valley</strong>, rewatching for the third time. The first time I watched it was in high school, I thought it was cool but as a liberal arts student, I didn&rsquo;t get much. The second time was after college graduation, about to study CS, I was more aspiring to the enthusiasm of these tech guys and many of the jokes. Recently, I finished watching it for the third time, and I&rsquo;ve finally become a tech guy as I wished. Especially the later parts related to blockchain and decentralized networks, there was a wonderful connection and resonance. It&rsquo;s a work that has influenced me a lot, like &ldquo;The Social Network&rdquo;. I wonder what I&rsquo;ll be doing the next time I rewatch it?</li>
<li><strong>She and Her and Her</strong>, I was attracted by the subject matter and the trailer. I can&rsquo;t arrogantly say that I can empathize with the difficulties faced by women, but there are still many points of empathy. Just after experiencing some emotional fluctuations left by &ldquo;The Stolen Bicycle&rdquo; last week, I watched this, and I&rsquo;m at a loss for words. The overall pace is not bad, but I still feel that the ending seems a bit too idealistic and slogan-like. Reality is much crueler.</li>
<li><strong>The Peripheral</strong>, currently watching.</li>

<p>This piece is a record and reflection of my life from <code>2022-11-01</code> to <code>2022-11-08</code>.</p>
<p>This week marked the first week of living with my cat. Due to the Double 11 shopping festival, I bought many cat facilities and food. With numerous deliveries arriving, I spent about half of my time working from home and receiving packages, which allowed for more bonding time. The cat is incredibly well-behaved. Over the weekend, I took her for a health check-up. Overall, she&rsquo;s healthy, though there are some concerning indicators regarding her eyes and digestive system. Medication was prescribed for treatment, and we&rsquo;ll go back for a follow-up next week.</p>
<p>Work-wise, I made good progress this week. Two projects are running concurrently, both with some advancements. I wrote a contract that was deployed to the production environment and created some practical scripts for common daily activities, significantly reducing repetitive and tedious tasks. I&rsquo;m quite pleased with the outcome.</p>
<h2 id="companionship">Companionship</h2>
<p>This was the first full week spent with the cat. Concerned about her state when I&rsquo;m away, I worked from home half the time. When at the office, I frequently monitored her through a camera (though most of the time, it was a non-static image of her napping on a chair, I could still watch for hours). There&rsquo;s an inexplicable sense of attachment.</p>

<p>I often thought of myself as someone who could handle solitude well, not requiring much companionship. Exploring interesting things or reading books and watching movies seemed sufficient to fill most of my leisure time. But gradually, I realized I was in a state of emotional isolation. Negative emotions slowly accumulated, yet they didn&rsquo;t affect my normal life and work. Conversely, the joy derived from daily life or work couldn&rsquo;t offset my negative feelings. Over time, I could sometimes clearly sense my emotional state.</p>
<p>During this week of cohabitation with the cat, I could feel myself relying on this feeling. Holding the cat while in a meeting or watching her play nearby made time flow slowly and beautifully. I slowly realized how long it had been since I last experienced such a feeling.</p>
<p>The bond between humans and cats is truly magical. Despite the language barrier and difficulty in empathizing emotionally, there seems to be a subtle understanding. One entrusts their sense of being needed, while the other quietly accompanies. I also plan to pick up my camera again to capture more of my daily life and the cat&rsquo;s routines. It seems I have something to look forward to every day now.</p>

<h2 id="another-way-of-life">Another Way of Life</h2>
<p>This week, I had dinner with a senior schoolmate whom I met in Hong Kong and who is now also living in Beijing. We might only meet three or four times a year, but each time brings quite different insights. Perhaps it&rsquo;s because each time I gain a new perspective on another way of life that I imagine and anticipate.</p>
<p>We are completely different people in terms of experiences and personalities. I have my own areas of focus, and I enjoy the work content itself and many things along this direction and field. It could be said that I&rsquo;m fortunate in some ways, yet I often wonder what my life would be like if I hadn&rsquo;t taken this path.</p>
<p>I was originally what you might call a &ldquo;slash youth&rdquo;, often learning and experiencing new things. Sometimes it was for the joy of mastering something new, sometimes simply for the immersion in the learning process. Later, I fell into a deep state of confusion, struggling with whether to pursue depth or breadth in knowledge and experience. In the end, I chose a more specialized field, and to some extent, gave up other possibilities.</p>
<p>My senior, on the other hand, is someone who can do her job well while also separating work from personal pursuits. On weekends and during leisure time, she goes rock climbing, dancing, swimming, surfing, boxing, and most importantly, painting. She explores her various interests and hobbies to the fullest, not caring too much about gains and losses, not pondering too much on meaning, but simply enjoying the process while simultaneously enjoying self-completion.</p>
<p>Despite being at an enviable stage in her career and personal development, she enthusiastically told me about her plan to take a gap year next year to attend a one-year full-time program at an art academy to study painting. It&rsquo;s not for any career change or direction adjustment, but simply because she likes it. For a moment, I couldn&rsquo;t tell if I was envying her ability to pursue something she &ldquo;simply likes&rdquo; to such an extent, or her ability to find such a passion.</p>
<p>Perhaps I&rsquo;ve also made some transitions at certain stages, whether in academics or career direction. It seems to require a certain kind of courage, but deep down I know I&rsquo;ve already balanced the costs and gains. It seems I haven&rsquo;t done anything for my inner pursuit and pure liking for a long, long time. The life my senior is experiencing and practicing is the other kind of life I once aspired to, and it shows me the possibility of another way of living.</p>

<p>I received a comment from a reader named seyee:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious if you actually finish all these books (I don&rsquo;t mean to question you, it&rsquo;s just that as a working-class person, I find it amazing to read so many books in a week)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s impossible to read so many books in a week. I have a habit of reading multiple books in parallel, especially for non-fiction books. I might read certain chapters every day, choosing different books based on the time of day and my mood. On average, it takes about two weeks to finish a complete book. However, if I come across an interesting fiction book, I might finish it in an afternoon or evening, or in two or three commuting periods. Most of the books listed are either just finished this week or have had some chapters read.</p>

<p>Regarding reading, I don&rsquo;t want to pressure or restrict myself with quantity or output. Instead, it serves more as an input channel and, to some extent, a means of relaxation (although I did feel emotional for several days after reading &ldquo;The Stolen Bicycle&rdquo;). I try to achieve a kind of emotional balance. It&rsquo;s also because of the pressure from work and various aspects that I take refuge in books, movies, and other media. It&rsquo;s more like my own pure land.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>My Profession is a Novelist</strong>, currently reading.</li>
<li><strong>Common Sense</strong>, currently reading.</li>
<li><strong>The Art of Self-Learning</strong>, I don&rsquo;t particularly like books that focus on tools and techniques, like &ldquo;How to Read a Book&rdquo;, but there are indeed many useful experiences to draw from. This book has been popular recently, so I&rsquo;ve just started reading it, hoping to find some methodological references.</li>
<li><strong>What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions</strong>, I discovered it&rsquo;s by the author of those stick figure comics. It really addresses many questions I was curious about as a child.</li>

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>This is a record and reflection of my life from October 28 to October 31, 2022.</p>
<p>As the previous weekly review was updated quite late, this period seems particularly brief in its time span. However, it holds special significance due to a major change that entered my life.</p>
<p>After a three-day journey to cat shelters from Friday to Sunday, filled with indecision, I brought home a silver point (silver shaded colorpoint? I just realized there are so many varieties) kitten that caught my eye. The name is yet to be decided, but I&rsquo;ve once again embarked on a life with a feline companion.</p>
<h2 id="him-and-his-cat">Him and His Cat</h2>
<p>This title is inspired by an anime called &ldquo;She and Her Cat,&rdquo; which contains a quote that left a deep impression on me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been searching for traces of her, and the reason I search for her is precisely because she is searching for me too. — &ldquo;She and Her Cat&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been fond of cats. Back in 2016, seeing a cafe owner&rsquo;s adorable Ragdoll cat sparked thoughts of owning one myself. But it seems that before my previous relationship, I had never truly considered the idea of having a cat, or rather, living a life accompanied by a feline friend. Perhaps the enthusiasm and patience for cats were there, but I always felt unprepared to take responsibility for a new life companion. My own life often seemed in disarray, so how could I presume to be responsible for another being&rsquo;s entire existence? I once came across a simple yet poignant saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A cat may only be a small part of your life, but you are its entire world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After settling into a stable work and life in Beijing, the idea of &ldquo;getting a cat&rdquo; seemed to happen naturally. I spent a weekend visiting several cat shelters and quickly decided on a kitten that caught my eye, whom I named Xiao Shu. Like first-time parents, I felt curious yet nervous about every aspect of this new companion.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/pity_and_ideas_in_hk.png" alt="pity_and_ideas_in_hk"></p>
<p>As days passed, it seemed to become an ordinary part of life, but in truth, it was far from a given. There was a time when I viewed the everyday as routine, believing that I and everything around me had changed, only to realize it was more self-satisfaction than anything else.</p>
<p>I must admit, shamefully, that during my previous not-so-brief experience of cat ownership, I was more focused on enjoying the role. I looked forward to companionship when busy and tired, sought comfort when in pain or depression, and found an outlet for joy and excitement. But when it came to the finer details of caring for a cat, I didn&rsquo;t pay much attention. Even now, I&rsquo;d struggle to accurately name Xiao Shu&rsquo;s favorite brand of cat food or canned food. I could hardly be called a competent caretaker.</p>
<p>What happened afterwards came about naturally, as I mentioned in a previous post, &ldquo;Weekly Review #08 - Career Musings, 404 Not Found, and Cats&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To be honest, I hadn&rsquo;t considered getting a cat before being with her. I suppose I felt that someone who couldn&rsquo;t even take care of themselves had no right to be responsible for another living being. But when we actually had a new family member, I gradually discovered that I enjoyed this sense of dependence and being depended upon. It seemed to give life many new goals.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>After she left, Xiao Shu was taken away too. Though I often jokingly tell friends that I&rsquo;ve lost &ldquo;both human and cat,&rdquo; I know deep down that my care wasn&rsquo;t as good as hers, so this choice was understandable. Still, every recollection of the past brings double the sadness.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>After watching the documentary &ldquo;The Secret Life of Cats&rdquo; last night, I gained more insight into many of the thoughts and interaction details of cats that I had previously overlooked. It vaguely sparked the idea of maybe getting another cat myself. But this feels like a betrayal to Xiao Shu, and I still haven&rsquo;t mentally prepared myself to properly care for a new member. Welcoming a new member when I&rsquo;m the one in need can hardly be called a responsible choice for either of us.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps someday in the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That &ldquo;someday in the future&rdquo; I mentioned has arrived.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Objects in the distance appear small and blurry, while things nearby are very clear. Memories are the same—distant past is vague, recent events are remembered in detail. It should be this way. But lately, I&rsquo;ve been able to recall past events with clarity. — &ldquo;She and Her Cat&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I originally thought this day would be far off, that it would only come when I could truly accept the past, when I could sincerely say &ldquo;let it go&rdquo; and face things calmly. But it&rsquo;s not like that. The more I try to forget, the clearer the memories become.</p>
<p>I often receive comfort or wishes to &ldquo;cherish the present,&rdquo; but for me, this is a rather tricky phrase. All past experiences have shaped who I am now; both the past and present are equally worthy of cherishing. I don&rsquo;t want to discard a complete version of myself just to escape negative emotions. I suppose I&rsquo;ll continue living with this mindset.</p>
<p>Psychologically, it&rsquo;s hard to say if I&rsquo;m truly prepared—prepared in all senses. My thoughts are a jumble. But I feel I should be ready to accept a new life companion again, or rather, I need this kind of mutual companionship. As I mentioned in &ldquo;Weekly Review #14 - Shelved Life and Self&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>October 10th marks the day we first brought Xiao Shu home. The hours spent lying on the couch, trying to lure her out with cat food, are still vivid in my mind. The joy of her first time in my arms is unforgettable. As this date approaches, I only feel increasingly sad.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Raising a cat is probably something that requires a lot of effort to do well. I originally thought we were taking care of the cat, giving her a comfortable living environment. Now I realize, it&rsquo;s I who needs her. I&rsquo;ll probably consider getting another cat sooner. When I can return to Beijing, I&rsquo;ll visit the previous cat shelter and see if I can add some anticipation and warmth to my life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this point, I&rsquo;m quite grateful to myself for setting the goal of writing weekly reviews. It allowed me to record these thoughts and the self-reflection behind them. Perhaps it&rsquo;s because of these words that I&rsquo;ve been able to find some answers to my questions.</p>
<p>Although the journey of wanting to raise another cat has been ongoing for a while, the final decision seemed more like a sudden impulse. After work on Friday, I went to a pre-booked cat shelter not far from the office. I originally intended to choose a Ragdoll similar to Xiao Shu, but was drawn to a small silver tabby. Perhaps it was her blue, crystal-clear eyes, or how she quietly and gently curled up on my leg as soon as she arrived.</p>
<p>Due to upcoming business trip plans, I was hesitant, thinking I might only be able to bring her home at the end of December. I feared missing crucial bonding stages and worried about the discomfort the journey and new environment might cause her. It seems that in moments like these, I start to consider many things.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, I still went to the originally planned cat shelter in Changping to look at Ragdolls. Because of the long journey, I started reading Murakami&rsquo;s &ldquo;Novelist as a Vocation&rdquo; on the way.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/life_about_cat_cunshang.jpg" alt="life_about_cat_cunshang"></p>
<p>He talked about his experiences right after graduation, which suddenly struck a chord with me. I realized it had been a long time since I felt this warm and hopeful feeling. Apparently, I needed companionship more than I had imagined.</p>
<p>After inquiring about the rules for inter-provincial pet transportation and communicating with my company, I decided to bring her home immediately, resuming a life with a cat. It&rsquo;s quite strange, really. Although nothing seems to have changed much, on the taxi ride home, as I chatted casually with the driver and occasionally glanced at the cat in her carrier, I suddenly felt that life was flowing again. The unfamiliar Beijing outside the window remained the same, but my heart felt a sense of belonging.</p>

<h2 id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h2>
<p>This section will record my inputs and outputs, as well as other things I find interesting.</p>
<h3 id="input">Input</h3>
<h4 id="books">Books</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Novelist as a Vocation</strong>, currently reading. Murakami&rsquo;s writing is truly fascinating, a blend of reality and self-mockery.</li>
<li><strong>Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach (6th Edition)</strong>, currently reading. It&rsquo;s a bit hard to digest.</li>
<li><strong>Programming in Lua, Fourth Edition</strong>, finished the video course, now consolidating through the book.</li>
<li><strong>Common Sense</strong>, still reading. As expected, not finishing it in one go during the trip has led to procrastination.</li>
<li><strong>The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind</strong>, just revisited. The deepest impression is how easily one can become less intelligent or ignore the errors in one&rsquo;s behavior when entering a group. Even if not directly causing harm, it&rsquo;s easy to become an accomplice who releases malice with a &ldquo;safety in numbers&rdquo; mentality. Some parts are quite referential, but there&rsquo;s also a strong personal bias. Whether malicious groups deserve to be saved is also worth pondering.</li>
<li><strong>Five Kinds of Time</strong>, curious to read after it was mentioned in Xiao Lu&rsquo;s video. I consider myself part of the group that pursues time management, knowledge management, etc., yet I still couldn&rsquo;t gain much benefit from this book. The theoretical explanations are too anecdotal, making it difficult to understand the experiences and thought processes behind these insights. The dialogic reasoning method of Adler in &ldquo;The Courage to Be Disliked&rdquo; would be much better in this aspect. As for the methodology part, the elaborate &ldquo;garden model&rdquo; is hard to relate to.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="tv-series">TV Series</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Silent Snow</strong>, watched the fourth episode and suddenly felt very sad. Although it was expected, I still feel sorry for Sodou (maybe because I relate strongly).</li>
<li><strong>The Peripheral</strong>, currently following.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="anime">Anime</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>She and Her Cat</strong>, a very short yet touching short film. Rewatched it because of the weekly review title, and it resonates especially strongly with me as someone who just adopted a cat. A cat may only be a small part of your life, but you are its entire world. Raising a cat is probably something that requires a lot of effort to do well. I originally thought we were taking care of the cat, giving her a comfortable living environment. Now I realize, it&rsquo;s I who needs her.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="games">Games</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Persona 5 Royal</strong>, long-awaited and finally available on Switch. I&rsquo;ve only played the tutorial part, but the art style, soundtrack, and gameplay design are all stunning. Sometimes it&rsquo;s enjoyable just to have it playing in the background while doing other things. Wonder when I&rsquo;ll be able to fully experience it.</li>

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>This piece is a record and reflection of my life from October 19 to October 27, 2022.</p>
<p>This week has been busy with work projects, with several consecutive days of overtime, but I&rsquo;ve finally completed my part of the requirements. However, during the spare moments, I managed to go through introductory tutorials for several languages I&rsquo;ve long wanted to learn, which was quite interesting. Additionally, the company arranged for me to give a technical presentation on smart contracts. I put effort into making a good PowerPoint presentation, and I must say, Apple&rsquo;s Keynote is truly excellent - the magic move and some built-in animation effects are incredibly smooth.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also tinkered with several small websites and systems, making my starter page increasingly rich. Apart from that, due to some personal planning issues, I&rsquo;ve decided to create bilingual versions of some of my previous projects and articles. In the future, I might write technical articles in English first and then translate them into Chinese (or vice versa?), except for weekly reviews. It feels like a lot of pressure, but I have to persist.</p>
<h2 id="pure-learning">Pure Learning</h2>
<p>This week, I&rsquo;ve been engrossed in learning many new technologies. I&rsquo;ve looked into the basic syntax of Lua, which I&rsquo;ve been curious about for a while - it seems useful for writing scripts and small games. I&rsquo;ve also done some introductory learning of C++, mainly to delve deeper into language mechanisms; this time, learning it has made me appreciate the ingenuity of language design even more. I&rsquo;ve also reinforced my understanding of Rust&rsquo;s basic syntax, which could be considered my second attempt at mastering it. Because I need to write some DApps, I&rsquo;m also in the process of learning React and TypeScript.</p>
<p>I continue to read those challenging books, like &ldquo;Computer Systems: A Programmer&rsquo;s Perspective (CSAPP)&rdquo; and the newly released &ldquo;Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach (6th Edition)&rdquo;. Progress is a bit slow, but I&rsquo;ll take it step by step.</p>
<p>In fact, learning these doesn&rsquo;t have such a strong purpose; most of them won&rsquo;t be used immediately at work (which is often the main reason why I sometimes find work a bit uninteresting). Without much practical application, I might often forget them, but the learning process itself is very interesting. I&rsquo;m gradually becoming fond of the Crash Course format - spending a few hours unveiling the mystery behind some technical terms or mastering some peculiar skills, feeling a sense of pure learning joy.</p>
<p>This seems to have been a long-standing habit. In university, I dabbled in learning several new foreign languages (of course, I gave up after a while; German as a second foreign language was somewhat mastered, but I don&rsquo;t know when I&rsquo;ll pick it up again - I regret not learning it properly), and learned the entire Adobe suite (many were a bit superfluous, but I did learn the useful ones quite well). Rather than the practical benefits a skill or a type of knowledge can bring, the motivation from exploration seems more important.</p>
<p>Currently, I also want to create some interesting things. I hope I can always find joy in what I do.</p>
<h2 id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h2>
<p>This section will record my inputs and outputs, as well as other things I find interesting.</p>
<h3 id="twitter-statistics-system">Twitter Statistics System</h3>
<p>Following the &ldquo;twiyou&rdquo; project by Twitter friend <a href="https://twitter.com/disksing">Ivory Mountain Liu Neng</a>, I set up my own statistics system, which is quite interesting.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/yu_twitter_monitor.png" alt="yu_twitter_monitor"></p>
<h3 id="blog-system">Blog System</h3>
<p>Although I&rsquo;ve often modified some theme settings before and even submitted PRs for the Hugo theme I use, I&rsquo;ve never really delved into Hugo&rsquo;s template system. I&rsquo;ve spent the past few days studying it thoroughly and plan to write some shortcodes for use. It&rsquo;s quite powerful.</p>
<p>The article section has been idle for a long time. I&rsquo;ve actually been keeping records in Logseq, but I haven&rsquo;t organized them meticulously. In the future, some content that may not be fully formed might be placed in the Notes module, which will be continuously updated.</p>
<h3 id="input">Input</h3>
<h4 id="books">Books</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind</strong>, currently revisiting.</li>
<li><strong>Programming in Lua, Fourth Edition</strong>, learned a bit of Lua, feels like an interesting language.</li>
<li><strong>Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach (6th Edition)</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="movies">Movies</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Au Revoir L&rsquo;été</strong>, the visuals are quite good, with several classic scenes often seen in mixes, but the plot and pacing are quite mediocre. I spent most of the time just enjoying the music, adding several songs to my playlist - they&rsquo;re great for video background music.</li>
<li><strong>Roma</strong>, a movie with incredibly slow rhythm and visuals, like a personal memoir, with some subtle metaphors in the context of the time, much like us who are at a loss in the current era.</li>
<li><strong>Everything Everywhere All at Once</strong>, it was incredibly popular a few months ago. I watched it tonight while working on my weekly review, and I was disappointed. It&rsquo;s a bit bewildering, with inexplicable emotional transitions and plot twists. It feels like it&rsquo;s trying to express too much and aims too high, but fails to support its core.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="tv-series">TV Series</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Playlist</strong>, stories are often similar, although it doesn&rsquo;t compare to &ldquo;The Social Network&rdquo; in my mind, but as an internet startup story, it&rsquo;s remarkably not solely focused on programmers, which is refreshing. I admire the tech geeks in &ldquo;The Coder&rdquo;, but my favorite is still Martin - unrestrained, understanding that the business and real world are not just binary, and someone needs to bear the cost for its idealism. Also, many transition scenes in &ldquo;The Lawyer&rdquo; are stunning.</li>
<li><strong>House of the Dragon</strong>, I&rsquo;m not really a Game of Thrones enthusiast. I stopped watching around the fifth or sixth season when I heard it had a bad ending, but I did read most of the books. I followed this because it was quite popular a few months ago. I almost gave up several times in the first few episodes, but I watched it sporadically to the end. I feel that such a grand worldview might be better suited for books to lay the groundwork, as the TV series always feels a bit disjointed.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="anime">Anime</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms</strong>, also recommended by a friend, with a slightly fantastical setting of an ageless clan. Under the grand worldview, it tells the entire story from the perspective of the passage of time and the beginning and end of human relationships, offering a different viewpoint.</li>
<li><strong>Pantheon</strong>, a colleague mentioned that this anime involves parallel computing, resource pools, deadlocks, and mutual exclusion locks, so I was curious to watch it. The first few episodes were very interesting, but it became somewhat abstract towards the end, making it tiring to watch. Perhaps it&rsquo;s because I watched it during lunch breaks and couldn&rsquo;t ponder it carefully, but overall it&rsquo;s still worth watching.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>This is a record and reflection of my life from October 10, 2022 to October 18, 2022.</p>
<p>Due to the pandemic, I had been staying at home in Hangzhou. As the weather turned cooler and I hadn&rsquo;t brought many clothes, I bought a ticket back to Beijing as soon as my health code turned green. I returned to Beijing on Friday. In just half a month, my home had become quite messy, so I spent almost the entire weekend cleaning and organizing.</p>
<p>Two projects have started to overlap, and my work efficiency at home hasn&rsquo;t been very high. It&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve properly learned something new, so I&rsquo;ve reorganized my study plan and schedule.</p>
<p>On a positive note, I finally managed to stick to morning runs for a few days, seeing the long-missed scenery of Hangzhou. However, I clearly felt that my physical fitness has declined. As autumn and winter approach, I might focus more on indoor exercises.</p>
<h2 id="a-memorable-conversation">A Memorable Conversation</h2>
<p>A friend I met in a university club, whom I&rsquo;ve always called my disciple, has completed his first novel and started a book recommendation channel on Bilibili. It feels like a serendipitous occurrence. I remember discussing writing such a work long ago, like a seedling hidden in memory, and now the first seed has begun to sprout. As a witness to this, I&rsquo;m genuinely happy. As the &ldquo;master,&rdquo; I find that some things I&rsquo;ve always wanted to do (like starting a Bilibili channel) have been continuously postponed. I should work harder too.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always cherished this kind of communication that isn&rsquo;t based on daily interactions. Although we haven&rsquo;t been in touch for nearly two years, I still discovered many similarities in our ideas and characteristics. It&rsquo;s like a magnetic field or tacit understanding. Interactions based on personality traits rather than daily routines or other purposeful communications are more likely to endure. It seems that all it takes is a thought, a &ldquo;By the way, I suddenly thought of&hellip;&rdquo; or an unprompted &ldquo;Shall we have a call?&rdquo; after several months to open up the conversation. It&rsquo;s a very pleasant relationship dynamic.</p>
<h3 id="gender-and-communication">Gender and Communication</h3>
<p>Initially, we discussed the issue of gender and communication. It was mentioned that it seems quite common for men to find it difficult to completely focus on content produced by women. It&rsquo;s as if they&rsquo;re particularly sensitive to photos, work, and emotional status, often overlooking viewpoint-based output, as if gender creates a barrier to equal communication.</p>
<p>This is an interesting phenomenon that seems to naturally exist in relationships between different genders. Due to some innate differences in the level of sensitivity, men are more likely to be the ones ignoring women&rsquo;s viewpoint expressions. Admittedly, I&rsquo;m not a particularly noble person either, and I can&rsquo;t help but be influenced by appearance or what we call charm in forming initial impressions. However, once a relationship enters the realm of friendship, I tend to ignore these factors in pursuit of more authentic and equal communication. Especially as I&rsquo;ve gradually become less dependent on social interactions, I&rsquo;ve come to cherish these opportunities for communication even more, and such sincerity often receives similar responses.</p>
<h3 id="creation-and-the-desire-to-share">Creation and the Desire to Share</h3>
<p>We also discussed the relationship between creation and sharing. In a sense, both my blog and my friend&rsquo;s book are forms of creation, and they are also carriers of our desire to share.</p>
<p>Writing, producing content, expressing ideas, or gradually realizing previously buried thoughts are manifestations of the desire to share. It&rsquo;s not about telling others that we&rsquo;re writing something seemingly impressive out of vanity, but rather about wanting to express ourselves sincerely, or hoping that our works, which we&rsquo;ve put our heart and soul into, will be taken seriously or receive some feedback.</p>
<p>My friend&rsquo;s analogy was apt: it&rsquo;s like shouting into a valley, hoping to hear an echo.</p>
<h3 id="introspection-and-external-seeking">Introspection and External Seeking</h3>
<p>What left a deep impression on me was the concept of &ldquo;introspection and external seeking.&rdquo; As humans, our focus is often divided into internal and external aspects. Comparatively, external focus tends to dominate due to its more stimulating nature and positive feedback, while internal focus is often easily overlooked.</p>
<p>It seems that from a certain stage, we begin to fear and be wary of our own changes. We worry about one day no longer being able to absorb books and movies, or having empty thoughts after experiencing them - how unimaginable and unacceptable that would be. At the same time, we seem to worry about ceasing to change, for how many interesting life stages would we miss then?</p>
<p>Upon reflection, I realized that I&rsquo;m actually afraid of losing the ability to introspect. External seeking always seems to have some answers, while introspection has no endpoint. If we lose our inner core, lose the curiosity and drive to explore ourselves, that would be the most fearful and unbearable thing.</p>

<p>This section will record my inputs and outputs, as well as other things I find interesting.</p>
<h3 id="input">Input</h3>
<h4 id="books">Books</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Art of Fiction</strong> by Somerset Maugham, an addition to the list. I first read it several years ago and have reread it several times since. It can be said to have reignited my passion for literary classics.</li>
<li><strong>Common Sense</strong> by Li Ao, a collection of political commentaries. I must say, some of the political views from so many years ago are quite interesting when viewed in the current Chinese environment.</li>
<li><strong>The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind</strong>, which I read in my freshman year. Revisiting it on the journey, it feels quite different, especially as one can feel individual characteristics gradually being erased in the present day.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="movies">Movies</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fall</strong>, I was on edge throughout the entire movie, and it was quite a different experience. The last time I felt this way was probably during &ldquo;The Walk.&rdquo; Although I&rsquo;m not afraid of roller coasters and such activities in daily life, I don&rsquo;t deliberately seek thrills either, so it&rsquo;s probably hard for me to understand this kind of experience. I&rsquo;m a bit curious though. I&rsquo;ve been thinking about going hiking recently, maybe I could try bungee jumping and skydiving later.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="tv-series">TV Series</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Terminal List</strong>, the setup in the first episode felt a bit tiring and depressing, but the pacing became very tight afterwards. PTSD and revenge elements are common in series now, but there were still many surprises. I looked it up and found out it&rsquo;s directed by the same person who did Person of Interest, which explains the familiar feeling.</li>
<li><strong>Ishiko and Haneo: You Can&rsquo;t Sue for This</strong>, I watched this drama because of a meme of Kasumi Arimura. The style is nice, but the plot and cases are just okay. Maybe it was originally intended more as a reflection of social conditions and for educational purposes. Also, why does it feel like there are more and more good new legal dramas recently?</li>
<li><strong>Empresses in the Palace</strong>, I watched it over the weekend at home. I wasn&rsquo;t interested in the theme before, and among historical dramas, I&rsquo;ve always liked &ldquo;Nirvana in Fire&rdquo;. However, after finishing it, I found many different points of attraction. The pacing of the series and the acting skills at that time were quite exceptional.</li>
<li><strong>Silent Snow</strong>, a new Japanese drama I&rsquo;m following. It&rsquo;s very beautiful.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="anime">Anime</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wolf Children</strong>, I suddenly came across this anime movie that I had bookmarked since high school while browsing my &ldquo;want to watch&rdquo; list on Douban, so I opened it and finished it. I really like the art style, especially the detailed depiction of natural scenery. Although the ending is fairly good in terms of plot, it still feels a bit depressing. I really like the personalities of the characters.</li>
<li><strong>Chainsaw Man</strong>, it was quite famous when I was in high school, but I didn&rsquo;t watch anime at that time. I&rsquo;m catching up now, and the first episode is quite good.</li>
<li><strong>Pantheon</strong>, I heard from a colleague that to watch this anime, you need to understand deadlocks, mutex locks, and parallel computing. That piqued my interest, so I started following it. The setting seems quite interesting.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="games">Games</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade</strong>, I&rsquo;ve played more than half of it, but I&rsquo;m getting a bit tired. It&rsquo;s quite brain-intensive. I&rsquo;ll finish it when I have more free time in the next wave.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>This piece is a record and reflection of my life from <code>September 27, 2022</code> to <code>October 9, 2022</code>.</p>
<p>This is a weekly review spanning quite a long period. The reason being that I took leave early on the morning of September 29 and returned to Hangzhou, followed by the National Day holiday, making it a small extended vacation. That week was mainly occupied with overtime work and the journey home, so I decided to merge it into one article.</p>
<p>I continued to be busy with the launch of the project at hand, and due to the pre-holiday adjustment, it was somewhat rushed. Although there was still much to adjust during the holiday that required overtime, the functionality was completed. Therefore, the week and more at home was somewhat relaxing. I spent time with family, met some friends, changed my hair color (to blue-gray), and also reorganized my suspended life.</p>
<h2 id="suspended-life-and-self">Suspended Life and Self</h2>
<p>Nearly half a year has passed since the mid-year changes in my life. I always thought I was experiencing inevitable forgetting, but the increasingly frequent dreams lately seem to mockingly remind me that it was merely suspended, never truly past.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t used to dream much before. Although I couldn&rsquo;t say I was without worries, my generally positive disposition also meant that troubles didn&rsquo;t significantly affect my life. However, lately, some real memories and scenarios have been reappearing through dreams, so real that every morning I feel somewhat bewildered, needing increasingly longer times to dispel these low spirits, or allowing them to grow and spread into the corners of my life.</p>
<p>Counting back, I suppose I haven&rsquo;t been completely dejected over the past half year. Work has been completed quite well, the blog I picked up again has gained some recognition and has a considerable number of visits; although I often slack off, I&rsquo;ve managed to keep up with the weekly reviews; my Twitter account, an outlet for my desire to share, has also accumulated some followers, making me a small tech+daily life blogger, and my channel for random thoughts is slowly filling with rich content. Meanwhile, I&rsquo;ve also read many books, watched movies, anime, and TV series that I had previously marked, and while I can&rsquo;t say my thoughts have changed much, I have been cultivating a habit of thinking.</p>
<p>It seems everything is on a good trend, but I always vaguely feel that something is missing.</p>
<p>I seem to always protect myself in a way that avoids falling into an extremely bad state. When I&rsquo;m feeling low and depressed in some aspects, I would force myself to invest energy in others, as if seeking some balance and decency in certain aspects. It&rsquo;s like observing my own life from an objective perspective, too calmly filling the gaps in life, while the meaning of life itself has been suspended, seemingly losing its importance and significance.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I wrote an article titled &ldquo;<a href="https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2020/06/06/yearly_review_23/">A Confession at 23: To Pursue Meaning</a>&rdquo;, which was quite a significant opening piece for this blog. Looking back at the words from that time, although I didn&rsquo;t arrive at any profound truths after stating some somewhat self-righteous insights and experiences, there was still some arrogance in seeking self and determination in constructing self.</p>
<p>However, now I seem to have suspended the matter of self along with the lack of meaning in life. It seems that as long as I can keep myself busy, everything is fine. The weekly review is a channel for self-reflection, but it can only address the current state and mood, and it&rsquo;s difficult to touch the depths of self.</p>
<p>Being able to see obvious decline but powerless to remedy it, this sense of powerlessness is not subjective self-numbness and indulgence, but a kind of suffocation and despair like drowning in the sea. Unable to save oneself, even harder to expect help from others, unable to see a lighthouse, only able to survive relying on occasional driftwood. I don&rsquo;t want to always leave behind some negative words, but during this holiday, I allowed myself to be swallowed by the whirlpool of emotions, almost unable to feel the passage of time.</p>
<p>October 10 marks the day I first brought Little Potato home. The hours spent lying on the sofa trying to lure her out with cat food are still vivid in my mind, and the joy of her first time in my arms is unforgettable. As this date approaches, I only feel increasingly sad.</p>
<p>Raising a cat is probably something that requires a lot of effort to do well. Originally, I thought more that we were taking care of the cat, giving her a comfortable living environment, but now I realize that it&rsquo;s me who needs her. I&rsquo;ll probably consider getting another cat sooner. After I can return to Beijing, I&rsquo;ll go to the previous cat shelter to have a look, to add some anticipation and warmth to my life.</p>

<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/rg351v_game_console.jpg" alt="rg351v_game_console"></p>
<p>Every year or two, I would revisit classic GBA games using phone emulators, but playing with virtual buttons always lacks that childhood feeling. I got a new toy from <a href="https://twitter.com/Ehco1996">@Ehco1996</a>, unlocking a new world of open-source handheld consoles!</p>
<p>Quickly revisiting Pokémon and Fire Emblem series (although I&rsquo;ve already completed them many times), happy!</p>
<h3 id="input">Input</h3>
<h4 id="books">Books</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Send You a Bullet&rdquo;</strong>, this is the most enjoyable book I&rsquo;ve read in the past two years. Because it&rsquo;s a collection of essays and notes, I can read a few pieces during commutes without feeling disjointed. I really like Liu Yu&rsquo;s style of speaking, with life essays interspersed with some political and cultural reflections. Several times I almost laughed out loud on the subway. I never knew words could present a person&rsquo;s way of life and the appearance of their world so concretely and authentically. Moreover, this kind of authenticity in writing and self-mockery is the state I aspire to. I hope that years later, when I look at my own writings, I can have this kind of pleasant surprise to some extent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Siddhartha&rdquo;</strong>, a very short book that I finished during a two-hour flight. Perhaps because I was physically isolated from external disturbances, it felt strangely peaceful. It talks about Indian religious philosophy, a pursuit of the pure and peaceful parts of human self. I heard a friend say they had gone through a stage where everything felt meaningless, closed off and painful. I often feel the same, which suddenly reminded me of Siddhartha. A complete person needs to experience Siddhartha&rsquo;s entire life, from rebelling against everything in the world and rejecting mediocrity, to self-discipline, suppressing desires, self-avoidance and comfort, then to beginning to know, learn and overturn oneself, self-contradiction, and finally to still following oneself, but being able to understand and sympathize with people and their ways of life. For me, the most profound point is that it warns from the perspective of a complete lifetime that life cannot find self by following rules or imitating and following others. Only through constant thinking and seeking can one truly understand oneself and life. It doesn&rsquo;t mean that everything must be experienced firsthand, but at least one should explore and experience rather than just take. I strongly recommend watching the analysis video by the treasure Bilibili uploader &ldquo;Naive and Sentimental Novelist&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Less Than One&rdquo;</strong>, I found it while organizing my bookshelf at home and discovered I had read it a few years ago, but my memory was a bit blurry. I&rsquo;m marking it here and will reread it when I have time. I really loved physical books back then.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="movies">Movies</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Bullet Train&rdquo;</strong>, it gave me a sense of déjà vu of &ldquo;Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels&rdquo;. The scene transitions and neon light narration settings were quite impressive, but the ending and background explanation felt a bit rushed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Manchester by the Sea&rdquo;</strong>, it might not be a suitable movie to watch when I&rsquo;m already feeling low, but I still watched it quietly to the end. Regret, emotions, family affection, the loneliness of a person - I can&rsquo;t say I empathize completely, but I did try to understand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Shin Ultraman&rdquo;</strong>, I didn&rsquo;t expect to still be able to watch an Ultraman movie, it still has that familiar feeling.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="tv-series">TV Series</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>&ldquo;The Terminal List&rdquo;</strong>, saw a recommendation, just started watching.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Kieta Hatsukoi&rdquo;</strong>, it&rsquo;s already finished, but I haven&rsquo;t watched it all yet. I saw Takegi&rsquo;s edits recently, so I thought I&rsquo;d watch the rest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>&ldquo;House of the Dragon Season 1&rdquo;</strong>, watched until the middle and thought it was okay, so I might as well finish it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Rick and Morty Season 6&rdquo;</strong>, maybe because I watched the previous seasons too quickly, following this season slowly allows me to discover more details.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="anime">Anime</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Summer Time Rendering&rdquo;</strong>, it has accompanied me through these six months. The setting, pacing, and plot are all very comfortable. I&rsquo;m satisfied with the ending. After all, who doesn&rsquo;t love sweet romance?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>&ldquo;My Stepmom&rsquo;s Daughter Is My Ex&rdquo;</strong>, setting aside the premise, it&rsquo;s more like a daily life romance anime in the middle and later stages. It&rsquo;s quite sweet.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="games">Games</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade&rdquo;</strong>, I recently bought an open-source handheld console on Xianyu, allowing me to catch up on the Fire Emblem series that I&rsquo;ve been longing for. I was too young at the time and couldn&rsquo;t fully appreciate the joy of tactical strategy games, which is somewhat regrettable.</li>

<p>This piece is a record and reflection of my life from <code>2022-09-19</code> to <code>2022-09-26</code>.</p>
<p>This week was unusually busy, with several days where I returned home quite late. Yet, strangely, it&rsquo;s during such times that I seem to find more motivation to do more. I finished a book, caught up on many movies and TV series, and accomplished numerous tasks, both big and small. Besides that, not much else happened, to the point where even writing this weekly review felt a bit dragging.</p>
<h2 id="the-joy-of-stealing-time-from-a-busy-schedule">The Joy of Stealing Time from a Busy Schedule</h2>
<p>Today, while scrolling through Twitter, I stumbled upon an interesting conversation between <a href="https://twitter.com/disksing">Ivory Mountain Liu Neng</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/cloudwu">Cloud Wind</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ivory Mountain Liu Neng</strong>: During work hours, I always think about doing side projects, but when the weekend comes, all I want to do is play games and watch shows&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Cloud Wind</strong>: Why not always work on side projects during work hours, and do actual work on weekends? This way, you won&rsquo;t play games or watch shows, because if you don&rsquo;t work on the weekend, you&rsquo;ll have done no work at all. There&rsquo;s another benefit to this approach: if your work is interdependent with colleagues, there won&rsquo;t be any conflicts since there&rsquo;s no parallelism. You can also fully consider the ever-changing product requirements before starting.</p>
<p><strong>Netizen</strong>: The implication of this idea is that the work can be done in two days.</p>
<p><strong>Cloud Wind</strong>: The actual effective workload of a long-term project is far less than 2/5, I&rsquo;d say. If it really can&rsquo;t be finished, you can extend your weekend work hours accordingly. Also, having five days a week to estimate this workload usually means you won&rsquo;t get it wrong. So, in essence, this method suggests: think more, do less.</p>
<p><strong>Ivory Mountain Liu Neng</strong>: The point about thinking more and doing less is indeed true. Often, the longer you delay, the smoother it goes when you finally start. However, doing serious work only on weekends seems quite challenging. I thought you were just joking, haha. And it probably wouldn&rsquo;t suit many people. For instance, if I pushed all my work to the weekends, I&rsquo;d probably end up slacking off due to the overwhelming pressure. 😳</p>
<p><strong>Cloud Wind</strong>: It&rsquo;s half a joke :) But in recent years, I&rsquo;ve indeed done a lot of key work on weekends/public holidays.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Upon reflection, I seem to have always had this tendency. In my sophomore year, when preparing for the TEM-4 and the software qualification exam, despite the already tight revision schedule, I somehow found time to learn many unrelated (but not entirely useless) things. The time squeezed out felt particularly precious, and everything I did carried an extra sense of joy.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m incredibly busy and fighting for every minute, I often have this thought: &ldquo;I can accomplish so much in this short week, so when I&rsquo;m done with exams/on holiday/have free time, I&rsquo;ll surely be able to learn/finish xxx.&rdquo; But when that moment actually arrives, I end up &ldquo;slacking off&rdquo; instead.</p>
<p>Thinking carefully, most of my extra skills or learned things were accomplished while &ldquo;neglecting my duties.&rdquo; Even now, long after, I still benefit greatly from them. Yet, those official tasks are often completed at the last minute before the deadline, seemingly with good results. This makes me ponder the correlation between time and efficiency, and how mindset affects one&rsquo;s motivation to do something.</p>
<p>Everyone has different patterns for task arrangement and time management. I might be an efficiency freak, but I&rsquo;m definitely not someone who&rsquo;s extremely meticulous about time arrangements. To some extent, I enjoy a sense of randomness that somehow manages to complete everything, rather than feeling enslaved by a task list. As a side effect of this mode, I often find myself having to &ldquo;turn the tide&rdquo; at the last moment. Over time, my mentality has become more stable, or rather, I&rsquo;ve accumulated some standards and confidence in my problem-solving abilities.</p>
<p>Additionally, inertia and enjoyment play important roles in this process.</p>
<p>This was particularly evident during the period from May to June when I was locked down at home due to the pandemic, unable to go out for nearly 50 days. During that time, because my mental state wasn&rsquo;t great, I threw myself into work. In the intervals between many meetings or tasks, I was constantly learning many extra things, and also started writing blogs to record again. It seemed as if I wanted to exhaust all my energy in extremely limited time. Even now, I still benefit from many of the accumulations, decisions, and habits cultivated during that period. But in the slightly idle period of July and August after the project ended, although I was still doing some things according to plan, it was hard to find the same sense of immersion as before.</p>
<p>Later, I realized it depends on how you view these things. Learning or relaxing during busy work times is an extra state outlet, allowing escape from the heavy and repetitive daily routine, making it easier to feel the joy in it. Moreover, it doesn&rsquo;t require much state adjustment or preparation steps at this time, and it&rsquo;s easier to switch relying on the inertia of the work state. However, when it comes to truly disposable free time, we have to treat it as a task item, needing to arrange time for it and switch ourselves back from a state of rest or entertainment, which costs more and encounters more resistance.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the possibly incomplete time after returning home on workdays, I will try to arrange some side projects or learning parts. Weekends, on the other hand, I hope to use more completely for outings or input activities like books, movies, TV series, or games. It seems that better segmenting my state might be a good approach, and I will try to explore it.</p>
<h2 id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h2>
<p>This section will record some of my inputs and outputs, as well as other things I find interesting.</p>
<h3 id="input">Input</h3>
<h4 id="books">Books</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Details of the Rule of Law</strong>, I had watched some videos of Professor Luo Xiang before and read his book &ldquo;Circle of Justice&rdquo;. Rather than saying he&rsquo;s &ldquo;clear-headed&rdquo;, I think Professor Luo just maintains a sense of &ldquo;awe&rdquo; and &ldquo;humility&rdquo; towards everything. On top of that, although he feels he can never achieve it, cannot draw a perfect circle, he&rsquo;s always in pursuit. I&rsquo;ve benefited a lot. The part about reading classics was very difficult, I reread it several times but still couldn&rsquo;t digest it. Such big themes as &ldquo;freedom, equality, and fraternity&rdquo; can be narrated so eloquently, indeed more accumulation is needed.</li>
<li><strong>I&rsquo;ll Give You a Bullet</strong>, currently reading, I really like Liu Yu&rsquo;s speaking style.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="podcasts">Podcasts</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fork It - #22 - PoW vs PoS</strong>, With the occurrence of &ldquo;The Merge&rdquo;, this topic has become popular again. It&rsquo;s a very good episode for concept clarification and exploration, worth listening to repeatedly and taking notes.</li>
<li><strong>Fork It - #23 - Is PoS a Lie?</strong>, It took three days of commuting to listen to it completely. I repeatedly went back to listen to several concept explanations and still found many loopholes in my understanding. I plan to look at BTC Study to supplement.</li>
<li><strong>Tech Hodgepodge: Have You Been Fooled by &lsquo;Sheep a Sheep&rsquo;?</strong>, A quite phenomenal game recently, but I&rsquo;m not very interested. I learned about it through this episode from the hosts. It&rsquo;s very short, but quite interesting as a popular science topic.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="movies">Movies</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spring Fever</strong>, At first, I felt the male lead was a bit too jumpy, but later I slowly realized that this is a lifestyle without limits, so joyful. Watching it back-to-back with &ldquo;The Breakfast Club&rdquo;, I felt my inner rebellion was awakened.</li>
<li><strong>Piper</strong>, Recently, I&rsquo;ve been working overtime to the point of mental exhaustion. I remembered some animated short films that had been lying in my list for a long time. Somehow very healing.</li>
<li><strong>Dallas Buyers Club</strong>, The film&rsquo;s depiction of despair and suffocation is too detailed. The sound effect of tinnitus and the cramped frame create a strong sense of immersion. I saw a cowboy&rsquo;s attitude towards life, seeming to be tired of everything yet truly loving life, appearing indifferent to others yet willing to devote true feelings, so cool. Also, although there&rsquo;s not much romance, the eye contact and expressions exchanged with the female lead in the latter half are really worth savoring for a long time, such a good match.</li>
<li><strong>In the Mood for Love</strong>, The repeated shots of walking through the alley and brushing past each other, the restrained depiction of desire and unspoken feelings, it turns out that love can truly grow and spread from the eyes and brows. You can feel its charm without it becoming vulgar, the grasp is just right, perhaps this is also the unique temperament of Hong Kong and that era. Also, I really like the English title of this film, &ldquo;In the mood for love&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s so beautiful.</li>
<li><strong>La La Land</strong>, Interestingly, I&rsquo;ve been to the live concert of the La La Land suite twice, but this was the first time I&rsquo;ve really watched the movie in full. Back in the distant 2016, I booked movie tickets for Valentine&rsquo;s Day when it first came out but missed it due to circumstances, and never made it up afterwards. Recently, a friend mentioned it, so I watched it over two nights, and only then did I truly feel the charm of the song &ldquo;City Of Stars&rdquo;, one song that walked through an imagined lifetime.</li>
<li><strong>Casablanca</strong>, When watching &ldquo;La La Land&rdquo;, the female lead mentioned watching this movie repeatedly as a child and imitating it, and it was also on my list before, so I dug it out to watch. I have to say that films from that era are indeed classic, not needing too much drawn-out plot, the dialogue is enough to present most themes. The final scene at the airport with the conversation between the three people, about revolution, nationality, and love, in just a few words, vividly presents each character&rsquo;s personality and corresponding choices, a unique charm.</li>
<li><strong>Dunkirk</strong>, There are no grand war scenes, just the constant switching between the devastation of war on the beach, the unwavering small boats at sea, and the dogfights in the sky, creating a strange sense of beauty. The contrast between the burning plane and the train running on the homeland at the end, the cost of war hidden beneath the speech, is heartbreaking.</li>
<li><strong>Nope</strong>, It took me about three times to finish watching it. The narrative is indeed a bit messy. Even halfway through, I was still somewhat confused. Perhaps it lacks build-up, and if it were that director, the plot progression might make more sense (but it&rsquo;s very understated). It&rsquo;s just that the motivation for the sibling pair to do these things is really insufficient (maybe it&rsquo;s some kind of strange family pride), to the extent that even at the end, I still couldn&rsquo;t quite understand.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="tv-series">TV Series</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Severance</strong>, A series with good reviews recently. I really like the overall style and pace, especially the opening, it&rsquo;s so stunning. The story setting is quite new, a rebellion against a distorted &ldquo;Work-Life Balance&rdquo; technology, but maybe because of the abrupt end of the first season, I always feel there&rsquo;s some lack of motivation. Looking forward to future developments.</li>
<li><strong>Capture</strong>, Among similar types, the most classic is still &ldquo;Person of Interest&rdquo;, but the unique compact rhythm of British dramas is also very suitable for this narrative style. I feel like I might have watched the first season several years ago, but there&rsquo;s no problem with connecting the plot. About halfway through, I could roughly guess the ending, but when the final twist of the large-scale show unfolded, it still got me fired up. I can only say, as expected of the BBC among BBC dramas, very strong.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>This is a record and reflection of my life from <code>2022-09-13</code> to <code>2022-09-18</code>.</p>
<p>The past week has been somewhat busy, oscillating between several projects, so I haven&rsquo;t had much input. I had to work over the weekend but didn&rsquo;t want to stay cooped up at home, so I went out and unexpectedly found a nice café where I spent a pleasant day.</p>
<h2 id="cyberspace">Cyberspace</h2>
<p>I previously learned about the concept of &ldquo;cyberspace&rdquo; from <a href="https://twitter.com/novoreorx">Reorx</a>&rsquo;s article &ldquo;<a href="https://reorx.com/blog/sharing-my-footprints-automation/">Using Automated Workflows to Aggregate Information Intake and Output</a>&rdquo;. The original quote is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cyberspace constitutes my spiritual world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard not to agree with this description.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure when it began, but I can clearly feel my dependence on information from the online world. Unlike gaming addiction or the often-criticized short video algorithm opium, my dependence isn&rsquo;t about mindlessly scrolling or escaping anxiety. It&rsquo;s a craving for information acquisition that has become internalized as a way of life.</p>
<p>Relying on the online world inevitably involves struggling with social media and algorithms. On one hand, we need to avoid being troubled by overwhelming anxiety-inducing information or &ldquo;peer pressure&rdquo; from our social circles. On the other hand, we must be vigilant against the information cocoons constructed by algorithms.</p>
<p>To be honest, this is quite difficult to achieve. Even though I have some ability to restrain myself and filter information, and I&rsquo;m consciously trying to do so, it&rsquo;s still hard to avoid being disturbed or guided by it. I eventually adopted a simple yet effective method - turning off the WeChat Moments entry and most app notifications.</p>
<p>I turned off my Moments entry one night in my junior year. The specific context and motivation are a bit blurry now, but this accidental act miraculously became a habit I&rsquo;ve stuck to until now. I want to say that this doesn&rsquo;t mean I no longer care about my friends or the people around me. After closing Moments, I often click into their avatars to check on their recent status when I think of certain people periodically, and maybe start a conversation about some content.</p>
<p>It might sound redundant. Compared to an instant red dot notification, we need to go through the cumbersome process of &ldquo;remembering a specific person/thing -&gt; finding the chat box -&gt; clicking on the avatar -&gt; viewing Moments -&gt; understanding recent status&rdquo;. But for me, it&rsquo;s like a metaphor for ritual. This deliberately created trouble constantly reminds me of the effort needed to maintain a relationship. Gradually, I have fewer friends, but the remaining ones become increasingly important.</p>
<p>In the past two years, I&rsquo;ve made some other changes. I turned off all app notifications except for instant messaging apps (WeChat, Telegram) and email. I also limited the number of follows on platforms that are mainly used for information acquisition without social attributes (such as Bilibili, Weibo) to within 100. If I add new ones, I filter and optimize previous follows to reduce irrelevant content interference.</p>
<h2 id="my-information-flow">My Information Flow</h2>
<p>Through this article &ldquo;<a href="https://reorx.com/blog/sharing-my-footprints-automation/">Using Automated Workflows to Aggregate Information Intake and Output</a>&rdquo; and the subsequent &ldquo;<a href="https://reorx.com/blog/0-cost-self-hosted-n8n-with-railway-and-supabase/">Building a Zero-Cost n8n Automation Platform with Railway and Supabase</a>&rdquo; iteration upgrade, I also built my own automated information flow platform - &ldquo;<a href="https://t.me/pseudoyulife">Yu&rsquo;s Life</a>&rdquo; using n8n and Telegram.</p>
<p>Referring to Reorx&rsquo;s list, I also sorted out my input and output sources:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Telegram</strong>, collecting my scattered information input and output on various platforms, and recently I&rsquo;ve been posting my thoughts on movies, books, and other reflections in the channel. I also follow some channels and groups to get some information or meet like-minded people, occasionally forwarding manually.</li>
<li><strong>Blog</strong>, currently the output channel I&rsquo;m most attentive to, now more like a life journal.</li>
<li><strong>Twitter</strong>, the main social platform I&rsquo;m using now, also a carrier of my desire to share, where I&rsquo;ve met and followed many interesting friends.</li>
<li><strong>Instagram</strong>, I just decided to resume using it recently, mainly to share some of my photography results and daily life.</li>
<li><strong>YouTube</strong>, I&rsquo;m a heavy user, watching a lot of technical tutorials and digital news, occasionally there&rsquo;s also a lot of fun content.</li>
<li><strong>Bilibili</strong>, mainly retained some bloggers I&rsquo;ve been following for many years, watching travel vlogs more, only viewing dynamics not homepage and hot topics. I had plans to run my own account before, but don&rsquo;t have any good ideas at the moment.</li>
<li><strong>Pinboard</strong>, a bookmark and website saving management tool, I&rsquo;ve saved a lot of important content in just a few months of use, heavily dependent on it.</li>
<li><strong>Instapaper</strong>, managing read-it-later, mainly for saving some high-quality or long articles.</li>
<li><strong>GitHub</strong>, also browsing daily, looking at some good projects, also using lists to manage Stars.</li>
<li><strong>Apple Music</strong>, daily music software (after all, the ecosystem is convenient), but the interaction with playlists feels very average.</li>
<li><strong>YouTube Music</strong>, subscribed to YouTube Premium so it came with this, don&rsquo;t use it much, but occasionally use it for retrieval.</li>
<li><strong>Spotify</strong>, mark good songs heard on the above two music softwares in Spotify and automatically sync to the channel.</li>
<li><strong>Douban</strong>, recording my books, TV series, movies, anime and games, also heavily used, trying to write my own review for every work I&rsquo;ve watched/played.</li>
<li><strong>Weibo</strong>, rarely post, also retained some familiar follows, occasionally will sync and share some updates but don&rsquo;t have much motivation.</li>
<li><strong>WeChat Moments</strong>, post photography and some articles I&rsquo;m happy with writing, basically at a frequency of occasionally proving I&rsquo;m still alive.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m like having an obsessive-compulsive disorder for information organization. I feel genuinely happy when I see these scattered digital traces of mine gathered into my personal little space. Flipping back when writing weekly reviews can also pick up quite a few interesting points. I hope to accumulate more and more things in the future.</p>
<h2 id="self-definition-and-boundaries">Self-Definition and Boundaries</h2>
<p>This weekend I might have been a bit rebellious, watching two teenage movies, &ldquo;<a href="https://movie.douban.com/subject/1295728/">The Breakfast Club</a>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<a href="https://movie.douban.com/subject/1295437/">Ferris Bueller&rsquo;s Day Off</a>&rdquo;, both very old films. The themes are similar to &ldquo;<a href="https://movie.douban.com/subject/1291548/">Dead Poets Society</a>&rdquo; which I&rsquo;ve watched several times - the insistence on one&rsquo;s own personality, the cognition and rebellion against authority, the impact on the boundaries of life and future possibilities, but perhaps more relaxed and humorous in comparison.</p>
<p>As experiences grow, I may not be timid in facing life and changes, and often make some different choices. But even now, I still feel that I am a person defined by inner boundaries, and I use this way and habit to define everything around me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t consider myself a person with strong &ldquo;creativity&rdquo;, so I often instinctively avoid related things or choices. I consider &ldquo;friendliness&rdquo; and &ldquo;politeness&rdquo; as my labels, so I&rsquo;m often unwilling to break them in some communications, and &ldquo;rationality&rdquo; and due &ldquo;persistence&rdquo; often give way to them. I might be willing to take responsibility for some of my seemingly crazy choices, but actually, I&rsquo;ve already assessed their cost and whether I can bear it in my heart, so I actually lack the courage to truly &ldquo;take risks&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same with family, friendship, and intimate relationships. I seem to have made some definitions for each relationship in my heart, and I believe I&rsquo;m following the boundaries within them. But emotions are not so clear-cut, I&rsquo;ve intentionally or unintentionally ignored this point, yet still feel that I&rsquo;m maintaining this balance.</p>
<p>This week, some subtle changes occurred in my relationships with people around me. My first feeling was at a loss, like the instinctive fear of facing changes. In addition to overcoming it, it&rsquo;s also very difficult to immediately sort out my emotions and thoughts. Perhaps this state can be called &ldquo;emotional overload&rdquo;. In this repeated process, I often wonder if I&rsquo;ve always been too obsessed with boundaries themselves and given up feeling the real changes in emotions and feelings, or if boundaries are just a self-protection mechanism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so hard.</p>
<h2 id="others">Others</h2>
<p>This part will record some of my input and output and other things I find interesting.</p>
<h3 id="input">Input</h3>
<h4 id="books">Books</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Sending You a Bullet&rdquo;</strong>, currently reading</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Details of the Rule of Law&rdquo;</strong>, currently reading</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="tv-series">TV Series</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Five Days at Memorial&rdquo;</strong>, it talks about some events during Hurricane Katrina in the United States. It inevitably reminds people of some things during the Wuhan epidemic. I don&rsquo;t have enough knowledge reserves on medical ethics or law to evaluate the justification of euthanasia in emergency situations. I just indeed saw the arrogance of politicians, the authenticity of human nature, and the insignificance of ordinary people in it. As it says in it, often without personal experience, one doesn&rsquo;t have the right to judge its rights and wrongs condescendingly.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="movies">Movies</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>&ldquo;The Breakfast Club&rdquo;</strong>, the sense of era and theme of old films might remind me a little of &ldquo;Dead Poets Society&rdquo;, but it&rsquo;s more relaxed and interesting. The student&rsquo;s perspective, a limited space scene, and a sufficient amount of dialogue combined in this way of expression make it easy for people to empathize. The natural display of rebellion and instinctive fear of authority (family, school), and the collective monologue at the end also makes one smile knowingly - a group of teenagers who don&rsquo;t want to be defined.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="anime">Anime</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Cyberpunk: Edgerunners&rdquo;</strong>, the plot is relatively conventional, and the art style is not particularly likable, but some designs and scene art are okay. Maybe because I haven&rsquo;t played the game itself, I don&rsquo;t have much empathy for the worldview and characters in it. It&rsquo;s a standard game peripheral animation.</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Summer Time Rendering&rdquo;</strong>, following the series</li>

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>This piece is a record and reflection of my life from <code>September 5, 2022</code> to <code>September 12, 2022</code>.</p>
<p>The past week was quite enriching, both during the workdays and the Mid-Autumn Festival holiday. Work gradually became busier but also more interesting; daily life saw some changes, no longer so dull and mundane; I&rsquo;ve grown accustomed to pulling out my Kindle for a few pages even during short car rides of just a few dozen minutes, quickly becoming immersed; going out has become more frequent, even if it&rsquo;s just aimlessly walking the streets.</p>
<p>Perhaps everything is getting better.</p>
<h2 id="mood">Mood</h2>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/yu_mood_review_20220913.png" alt="yu_mood_review_20220913"></p>
<p>Though I&rsquo;m not usually talkative, I&rsquo;m quite an emotional person overall. I can be saddened by sudden intrusive thoughts, lost in contemplation for a long time because of a movie&rsquo;s ending, and inexplicably delighted by small details in life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not an optimistic person about life. Even now, I feel that misfortunes in life far outweigh the lucky moments, and when suffering, I often feel I deserve to bear these burdens. Over the past year or two, I&rsquo;ve experienced many painful events - some were natural disasters or human tragedies, leaving regret and unwillingness; others were self-inflicted, causing self-reproach and remorse. Fortunately, I have a few close friends who, though not always by my side, often illuminate my darkest moments like winter sunshine with those comfortable times we shared in the past.</p>
<p>But sometimes one needs to step out of their corner and walk in the sunshine.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This morning I woke up a bit late. When I came out for work, the sky was already quite bright, though the temperature was still pleasant with a bit of wind. As I was listening to music (Mayday&rsquo;s &ldquo;Tenderness&rdquo;), I suddenly felt very, very good. It&rsquo;s been a long, long time since I felt so relaxed, this kind of joy from the bottom of my heart.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m very grateful to have such moments, even if it&rsquo;s just a fleeting emotion, it makes me feel that I&rsquo;ve reconciled with certain parts of myself, along with the surrounding time and space.</p>
<h2 id="travel">Travel</h2>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t consider myself a travel enthusiast. In the past, I mostly spent my free time at home. The thought of planning various travel matters would dampen my enthusiasm by half, let alone having to endure the crowds and noise of popular tourist spots.</p>
<p>After buying a camera, I started to have some thoughts of going out. I often carried my camera with me when I went out during internships and work, unknowingly walking through many cities and capturing many memories. Later, after watching &ldquo;<a href="https://space.bilibili.com/37029661">Little Deer Lawrence</a>&quot;&rsquo;s travel photography videos, I listed one item after another on my travel list, but never managed to fulfill them.</p>
<p>I had plans to travel to Qingdao in August, but couldn&rsquo;t make it due to work and some trivial matters (probably more because of laziness), and then the epidemic started spreading to various places again, so it kept being postponed. So when I suddenly learned that I had to go on a business trip to Qingdao on the second day of the Mid-Autumn Festival, the joy even overshadowed the pressure of the sudden work task.</p>
<p>I booked a ticket for early the next morning, catching up on sleep while watching the scenery along the way. Upon arrival, I was lucky to meet a local taxi driver. After chatting for a bit, I made a spontaneous decision to change my itinerary, asking him to take me on a tour around the seaside. We drove, stopping here and there, getting out to enjoy the sea breeze when we encountered nice scenery, and taking a few photos along the way.</p>
<p>This one-hour journey seemed like a condensed version of a Qingdao tour. I didn&rsquo;t look at any travel guides, didn&rsquo;t rush between several scenic spots. Some scenery was missed, but there wasn&rsquo;t much regret; while some emotions were felt, they became a beautiful part of the memory, worth a smile even after a long time.</p>
<p>Because I only brought a light 55mm F1.8 lens, and due to time constraints, I could only take distant shots, so the results of the hurried few shots were not very satisfying. But at least some memory points were left, and I managed to string together a theme &ldquo;People by the Sea&rdquo;.</p>

<h2 id="serendipities">Serendipities</h2>
<p>Actually, it was the same when I went to Thailand with my close friends before. Rather than the prosperity and bustle of Bangkok, we stayed longer in Chiang Mai, sometimes just walking on the streets looking for inconspicuous food, or exploring another side of the city following Pokémon Go activities.</p>
<p>I increasingly feel that for me, the focus of travel is no longer those &ldquo;top ten&rdquo;, &ldquo;must-visit&rdquo; and &ldquo;breathtaking&rdquo; sceneries, but the emotions felt during the journey, and the time spent with companions. In this state of mind, all the unexpected encounters become even more beautiful.</p>
<p>I watched Little Deer&rsquo;s latest video - &ldquo;<a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1pe411g7om">How Desperate is a Trip Without a Plan&hellip;</a>&rdquo;. Maybe, the next stop will be Yunnan.</p>
<h2 id="others">Others</h2>
<p>This section will record some of my inputs and outputs, as well as other things I find interesting.</p>
<h3 id="work">Work</h3>
<p>This week at work, I did some development involving chain interaction, which was quite interesting. Later, I also want to study more about on-chain data processing. I&rsquo;ve also started to write some production-level smart contracts. There are quite a lot of work tasks, and I need to launch two new modules that I&rsquo;m responsible for before National Day, so I need to work hard.</p>
<h3 id="blog">Blog</h3>
<p>Surprisingly, an article I wrote &ldquo;<a href="https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2022/09/05/database_postgres_basic/">PostgreSQL Basics and Practice</a>&rdquo; received a lot of attention and feedback. I will continue to write about work practice series in the future. Currently, I have completed:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2021/03/29/database_mysql_basic/">MySQL Basics and Practice</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2022/09/07/container_docker_basic/">Docker Basics and Practice</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Other than that, I also caught a Go hot topic and translated an article for GoCN&rsquo;s first release:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2022/09/10/vulnerability_management_for_go/">[Translation] New Go Vulnerability Management Tool: govulncheck</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There are still many themes I want to write about, I can&rsquo;t be lazy anymore in the future.</p>
<h3 id="input">Input</h3>
<h4 id="books">Books</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hackers and Painters</strong>, which I&rsquo;m reading on my commute. I originally thought it would be some practical content like soft skills, and I was reading it as a way to pass time on the journey, but surprisingly, many ideas are quite interesting, and the writing style is very comfortable. I&rsquo;ve always felt that coding, painting, or writing are different forms of creation, all of which can make people feel the joy of creation, but few books can express this part so naturally.</li>
<li><strong>I&rsquo;ll Give You a Bullet</strong>, currently reading</li>
<li><strong>The Details of the Rule of Law</strong>, currently reading</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="movies">Movies</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blue Gate Crossing</strong>, my deepest impression of Taiwanese films before should be &ldquo;A Sun&rdquo;. Many dialogues, monologues, and long shots, many scenes are like trying to capture fragments of memory. I watched &ldquo;Blue Gate Crossing&rdquo; during the holiday. The texture of early youth films is really exquisite, interpreting &ldquo;aesthetic&rdquo;, a description that was later overused. Chen Bolin&rsquo;s &ldquo;In Time With You&rdquo; influenced many parts of my youth, and even some ideas and qualities have deeply entered my personality itself. My impression of him is mostly steady and warm, the kind of person I want to become. In this film, I saw a similar but different him. One thing I like is that he always seriously and firmly repeats his words, whether it&rsquo;s self-introduction or angry questioning, as if confirming something with himself, but also with some timidity unique to youth. The last monologue is also very touching, I finally found the source of this sentence I liked before - &ldquo;Although I can&rsquo;t see myself with my eyes closed, I can see you.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>I Am Not Madame Bovary</strong>, another ensemble film, which happens to be my favorite narrative style recently. I don&rsquo;t know whether to blame it on the era or human nature, chaotic and ridiculous political correctness intertwines to influence the various directions of things. Politics, love, women, it encompasses too many themes, but doesn&rsquo;t make people feel the sense of detachment from the story. The comedy and humor parts never intended to cover up its tragic core from the beginning, so that by the end, although there&rsquo;s some sadness, there&rsquo;s more helplessness.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="anime">Anime</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Summer Time Rendering</strong>, following</li>
<li><strong>My Stepmom&rsquo;s Daughter Is My Ex</strong>, following</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="photography">Photography</h3>
<p>Currently, I&rsquo;m using Sony A7M3, mainly attracted by its video performance. I also bought a DJI stabilizer to shoot some videos, but then I can&rsquo;t take care of photography. I&rsquo;m thinking about having another device for street photography when traveling later, and I&rsquo;m a bit tempted by Fuji Xpro3, especially its optical viewfinder and film simulation, which are so ceremonial.</p>
<p>But I should go out more and take more photos before updating my equipment.</p>

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>This is the first article in the container section of the work practice series, primarily introducing the basic knowledge and practices of Docker.</p>
<p>As a backend developer, when I first started working, I mainly debugged locally and hadn&rsquo;t really learned about Docker usage. It wasn&rsquo;t until later when I began to engage with more complex underlying chain development that I encountered issues. Because of the intricate dependency relationships of chains or their related tools, along with version conflict problems, configuring complex environments on local machines or servers each time became necessary. Moreover, many services and configurations needed to be redeployed after every restart, making the process cumbersome and prone to inexplicable cross-platform errors.</p>
<p>Therefore, I gradually began to adopt the approach of writing project-specific Dockerfiles and compiling images for subsequent development and debugging. Deployment machines only needed to install the Docker environment (and Docker Compose), without the need to install various dependencies locally, which was very convenient. Later, together with my team leader, we configured the project&rsquo;s CI/CD process based on Docker images, GitLab CI, and the k8s environment, greatly improving development and debugging efficiency.</p>
<p>This article will summarize Docker-related concepts and practices based on these experiences, hoping to be of some help.</p>
<h2 id="introduction-to-docker">Introduction to Docker</h2>
<p>The services we develop often run as binaries in the operating system, while Docker is a container technology that packages our application and related dependencies in a container. Containers are typically based on a lightweight Linux image and are a stack of multiple layers of images. Our application is usually at the top layer, and these dependency relationships are specified in the Dockerfile.</p>
<p>Using containers for deployment has many clear advantages over deploying on local machines or remote servers.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>No need to install various environments and dependencies on the operating system (except for Docker itself). If we adopt the original service startup mode, the development process would become very cumbersome, requiring constant communication between developers and operations to complete environment configuration and deployment. Moreover, if multiple services are deployed on one machine, it&rsquo;s very easy to cause dependency/version conflict issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can have independent deployment environments. We build images by writing Dockerfiles for different projects, packaging the required environment and dependencies for the application in the image. This makes it convenient to run different versions of the same application, or run multiple instances of common services like MySQL. These can be managed through Docker commands or Docker Compose commands, allowing one-click startup/pause.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Docker is not strongly dependent on the version of the operating system itself. The same Docker image can run on different operating systems (Windows, macOS, different distributions of Linux), facilitating service sharing, migration, and cross-platform deployment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compared to virtual machines, Docker containers do not have a kernel and only contain the application layer, making them smaller in size, faster to start, and more lightweight.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, the compatibility of Docker containers is relatively poorer compared to operating systems and virtual machines. For example, VMs can run any other operating system and can meet more specific needs.</p>

<h3 id="installing-docker">Installing Docker</h3>
<p>Installing Docker is simple. Download the installation package corresponding to your operating system from the <a href="https://www.docker.com">official website</a> and follow the instructions to install.</p>
<h4 id="macos">macOS</h4>
<p>For my personal macOS system, I initially installed <a href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/">Docker Desktop</a>, which allows management of images and containers through a graphical interface. It&rsquo;s convenient but consumes more resources and is power-intensive.</p>
<p>Later, I tried <a href="https://github.com/abiosoft/colima">Colima</a>, a relatively lightweight container runtime environment. It&rsquo;s very convenient for local debugging on macOS systems. I recommend using it. You can install and configure the environment according to the project&rsquo;s official documentation. I installed it directly using the <code>brew</code> package management tool:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">brew install colima
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>After installation, run <code>colima start</code> to start the container, and <code>colima stop</code> to stop the container. More commands can be viewed through <code>colima --help</code>.</p>
<p>I started my common development environment with the following command, which you can configure according to your own needs:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">colima start -c <span class="m">8</span> -m <span class="m">16</span> -a x86_64 -p docker-amd
</span></span></code></pre></div><h4 id="centos">CentOS</h4>
<p>Compared to local development, Docker is more commonly used for deploying applications on servers. My frequently used operating system is <code>CentOS 7</code>, which can be installed through the <code>yum</code> package management tool:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">yum install -y yum-utils device-mapper-persistent-data lvm2

<p>Docker mainly has two concepts: images and containers. An image can be considered as a template for a container compiled through a Dockerfile, while a container is an instance of an image.</p>
<h4 id="dockerfile">Dockerfile</h4>
<p>We use Dockerfile to specify the environment and dependencies required for the application. Its basic format is as follows:</p>

<p>Of course, sharing through image <code>tar</code> packages is not so convenient, and some images may be very large, making transfer inconvenient. Therefore, we can use the <code>docker push</code> command to push images to the official image repository or enterprise/personal private repositories (like the project I&rsquo;m working on uses Harbor to manage images), and use the <code>docker pull</code> command to pull them.</p>

<p>After running services with Docker instances, our data will be saved in the containers. When the containers are deleted, the data will also be deleted, which can cause data loss for some services that need to run for a long time. Therefore, we need to persist the data. I commonly use host mounting and container mounting.</p>
<p>We can achieve persistence by mounting a specific directory of the host machine to a directory inside the container:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c1"># Mount host directory to container directory</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="docker-compose">Docker Compose</h2>
<p>Docker provides rich commands for us to use, but using command-line operations is not easy to remember, and if an application depends on multiple environments/services, it requires running and managing multiple containers separately, causing inconvenience. Therefore, we can use the Docker Compose tool for management.</p>
<p>Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications, which uses <code>.yaml</code> files for configuration management. In my daily work, I use Docker Compose most frequently, only using the <code>docker run</code> command to start very simple applications, which is also convenient for unified management and subsequent configuration adjustments.</p>
<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>
<p>If you have installed Docker Desktop on macOS, it already comes with Docker Compose, which can be used directly. If it&rsquo;s a Linux system, it needs to be installed separately. Here I&rsquo;ll take <code>CentOS 7</code> as an example:</p>

<p>The above is my explanation of the basic knowledge and practical operations of Docker container technology. I hope it&rsquo;s helpful to you. In fact, there&rsquo;s still a lot more content about Docker. For example, in the previous project, we tried to use Docker&rsquo;s <code>Buildkit</code> feature, which greatly reduced the size of the final built image, and used <code>buildx</code> to achieve cross-platform compatibility, etc. This article aims to explain basic knowledge and commonly used commands in practice. If you&rsquo;re interested in these extended parts, I&rsquo;ll update them later.</p>

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>Recently, I&rsquo;ve been thinking about organizing and summarizing the technical points and tools commonly used in my work. On one hand, this helps me review these knowledge points and deepen my memory of their usage. On the other hand, it can serve as a reference for future use.</p>
<p>Currently, I&rsquo;m planning to cover several core areas including databases, CI/CD (GitHub Actions + GitLab CI), containers (Docker + k8s), operations (Ansible, etc.), as well as some summaries of language features, practical Git techniques, and Shell scripting tips. Since I&rsquo;ve only encountered many of these topics at work and done some extended learning on my own, they may not fully align with specific enterprise practices (mostly based on my own experiences and understanding). I hope this can be helpful.</p>
<p>This article is the PostgreSQL part of the database series. I&rsquo;ve previously summarized MySQL, which you can refer to in &ldquo;MySQL Basic Knowledge and Related Operations&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="overview-of-data-and-databases">Overview of Data and Databases</h2>
<h3 id="data">Data</h3>
<p>Fundamentally, data is a type of fact or observed result, a logical summary of objective matters, and a form and carrier of information. People have been managing data since ancient times (even before the concept existed), initially through manual management, then gradually through file systems (like libraries, managing different information by categories), and finally, with the development of computer technology, forming the more convenient and efficient mode of database management.</p>
<h3 id="database">Database</h3>
<p>A database is a repository that organizes, stores, and manages data according to a certain data structure. Its main characteristics are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Structured</li>
<li>Shareable</li>
<li>Low redundancy</li>
<li>High independence</li>
<li>Easy to expand</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to understand that data organized according to different relationships/structures have different characteristics and are suitable for different application scenarios. Currently, there are mainly three types: hierarchical databases, network databases, and relational databases. PostgreSQL, which we will focus on, is a relational database.</p>
<h3 id="database-management-system-dbms">Database Management System (DBMS)</h3>
<p>A Database Management System (DBMS) is a system that performs various operations on databases. It has core functions such as establishing and maintaining databases, organizing and managing data storage, controlling databases, defining data, manipulating data, and managing communication between data. Different database management systems handle databases and data differently, and the way data is presented also varies. It often requires choosing an appropriate database management system based on factors such as data scale and business requirements. For example, in situations with massive data and high-concurrency data read/write operations, the performance of relational databases can deteriorate significantly.</p>
<h2 id="relational-database-management-system-rdbms">Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)</h2>
<h3 id="main-characteristics">Main Characteristics</h3>
<p>Relational databases primarily present data in the form of data tables, with each row representing a record and each column corresponding to the data field of the record name. Many rows and columns form a single table, and several single tables form a database. Users/systems query the database through SQL (Structured Query Language).</p>
<p>Some relational database operations have transactional properties, namely the ACID rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Atomicity</li>
<li>Consistency</li>
<li>Isolation</li>
<li>Durability</li>
</ul>
<p>Atomicity means that a series of transaction operations must either all complete or all fail; there is no situation where only part is completed. For example, in a bank transfer scenario, after the transfer occurs, the sender&rsquo;s balance decreases, but if a database operation error occurs and the receiver&rsquo;s balance does not increase, it would cause serious problems.</p>
<p>Consistency means that after a transaction is completed, the data in the entire database is consistent; there should be no situation where the same data is out of sync within the database.</p>
<p>Isolation means that different transactions should run independently and without interference. Of course, this sacrifices some efficiency but provides better guarantees for data accuracy.</p>
<p>Durability means that when a transaction is completed, its changes to the database and its effects on the system are permanent.</p>
<h3 id="data-integrity">Data Integrity</h3>
<p>Data integrity is a very important requirement and property of databases, referring to the consistency and reliability of data stored in the database. It is mainly divided into four types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Entity integrity</li>
<li>Domain integrity</li>
<li>Referential integrity</li>
<li>User-defined integrity</li>
</ul>
<p>Entity integrity requires that each data table has a unique identifier, and the primary key field in each table cannot be empty or duplicate, mainly meaning that the data in the table can be uniquely distinguished.</p>
<p>Domain integrity is to make some additional restrictions on the columns in the table, such as restricting data types, check constraints, setting default values, whether to allow null values, and value range.</p>

</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="w"></span><span class="p">);</span><span class="w">
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Referential integrity means that the database does not allow referencing non-existent entities. Tables in the database often have some associations with other tables, and referential integrity can be ensured through foreign key constraints.</p>
<p>User-defined integrity is to make some semantic restrictions on data according to specific application scenarios and involved data, such as balance cannot be negative, etc. It is generally constrained and limited by setting rules, stored procedures, and triggers.</p>
<h3 id="mainstream-rdbms">Mainstream RDBMS</h3>
<p>Currently, the mainstream relational database management systems include:</p>
<ul>
<li>SQL Server</li>
<li>Sybase</li>
<li>DB2</li>
<li>Oracle</li>
<li>MySQL</li>
<li>PostgreSQL</li>
</ul>
<p>Oracle, MySQL, and PostgreSQL are more commonly used by enterprises and individuals. Next, we will use PostgreSQL as an example for detailed operation explanations.</p>
<h2 id="postgresql">PostgreSQL</h2>
<h3 id="installation-and-configuration">Installation and Configuration</h3>
<p>PostgreSQL is a modern open-source object-relational database management system.</p>
<p>For individual users learning to use it, you can directly download the software installation package to set up a local environment. You can choose different versions according to different systems, and it also has a convenient graphical interface for starting, stopping, restarting services, and making related configurations. This article uses PostgreSQL 14 on macOS as an example. After installing and performing basic settings from the <a href="https://postgresapp.com">official website</a>, you can manage the local PostgreSQL service. The version may vary slightly, but the core functions are not much different.</p>
<h4 id="graphical-interface">Graphical Interface</h4>
<p>Open the PostgreSQL.app application, and you will see the following interface:</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/mac_postgres_interface.png" alt="mac_postgres_interface"></p>
<p>In this management interface, you can conveniently start and stop the PostgreSQL service. Clicking on the corresponding database also allows you to enter the command-line operation interface.</p>
<h4 id="command-line-interface">Command-line Interface</h4>
<p>First, we add the <code>psql</code> path to the environment variables for subsequent use. I use <code>zsh</code>, so I add the following content to the <code>~/.zshrc</code> file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c1"># postgres</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nb">export</span> <span class="nv">PATH</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="si">${</span><span class="nv">PATH</span><span class="si">}</span>:/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/14/bin
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>After that, enter <code>psql</code> in the terminal to access the PostgreSQL command-line interface. You can use the following command to view the psql command list:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">psql --help
</span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id="connecting-to-postgresql">Connecting to PostgreSQL</h3>
<p>We can connect to the database using the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c1"># Connect to the database</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">psql -h &lt;host&gt; -p &lt;port&gt; -U &lt;username&gt; &lt;database-name&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Of course, we can also use some third-party tools to connect to the database more conveniently. I currently use <a href="http://tableplus.com">TablePlus</a>, which supports PostgreSQL databases, and I recommend it.</p>
<h3 id="command-line-interaction">Command-line Interaction</h3>
<p>PostgreSQL provides powerful command-line interaction functionality. We can use <code>\</code> + keyword to perform operations. We can view command details and help information by consulting the documentation or using the <code>\?</code> and <code>help</code> commands. Other commonly used commands are as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c1"># View help</span>

<p>After configuring and connecting to the local PostgreSQL, we can perform some operations on the database. SQL language is mainly divided into the following four categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>DDL (Data Definition Language)</li>
<li>DML (Data Manipulation Language)</li>
<li>DQL (Data Query Language)</li>
<li>DCL (Data Control Language)</li>

<p>This piece is a record and reflection of my life from <code>2022-08-29</code> to <code>2022-09-04</code>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve discovered that I&rsquo;ve accumulated many unedited original photos from the past. I&rsquo;m slowly organizing them now. Currently, I&rsquo;m selecting a work that fits the theme as much as possible for each cover image. I&rsquo;ll see if I can select some as specific themed portfolios later.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m quite surprised to hear from several friends in real life that they&rsquo;re following my weekly reviews. When chatting about certain topics, they would say, &ldquo;You mentioned this in your previous weekly review.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s also an unexpected person who resumed some contact because of the weekly reviews. It feels quite fascinating that the carrier of my desire to share is slowly connecting with and influencing my real life.</p>
<h2 id="returning-to-the-past-regrets-and-the-present">Returning to the Past, Regrets and the Present</h2>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/back_to_campus.jpg" alt="back_to_campus"></p>
<p>Due to a conversation, I spent a sleepless night on Friday, with many memories from my student days constantly resurfacing.</p>
<p>The next day, feeling somewhat unsettled, I rewatched an old Japanese drama &ldquo;Proposal Daisakusen&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s about the male protagonist returning to the past through photographs to make up for regrets, only to find that no matter how he tries to mend things, he can&rsquo;t change the outcome. He ultimately decides to take action in reality.</p>
<p>Actually, when I watched it a few years ago, I was always a bit puzzled: Is it really meaningful to pick up old regrets after many years and try to achieve a happy ending? In other words, isn&rsquo;t this just a blind pursuit of the beautiful imagination projected by the filter of memory? Just like the youth and beauty emanating from those time-traveling photographs, they exist in memory, and only in memory.</p>
<h3 id="returning-to-the-past">Returning to the Past</h3>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know whether to call it fortunate or unfortunate, but I once had an experience that could be called &ldquo;returning to the past&rdquo;. The story isn&rsquo;t complicated. A girl I liked in middle school crossed paths with me again in my freshman year of college due to some connections. Perhaps it reignited some inexplicable feelings, and we got together, only to break up after a little over a month.</p>
<p>Perhaps because everything happened too quickly, there wasn&rsquo;t time to leave behind much beauty. Only a post with the general meaning &ldquo;Freshness isn&rsquo;t experiencing known things with unknown people, but exploring unknown things with known people&rdquo; was forgotten in some corner of memory.</p>
<p>In fact, the hurt brought by the end of that relationship is no longer important, but its existence itself has special significance. The me in middle school was probably dull and slow, unable to hide my liking for her but only able to express it clumsily. There was no protagonist halo in reality, naturally no happy ending, but that was indeed the first time I felt an emotion called &ldquo;liking&rdquo;. And &ldquo;coincidentally&rdquo;, this &ldquo;continuation of fate&rdquo; in college was also my first relationship.</p>
<p>The same person carried two different layers of emotion and meaning. Perhaps it should have been a beautiful story, the ever-popular love theme of &ldquo;making up for the regret of first love after many years&rdquo;. But when I truly entered this relationship, I found it wasn&rsquo;t so. The obsession left after the wear and tear of time and growth on the original liking was torn to shreds by this reckless act.</p>
<h3 id="regrets-and-the-present">Regrets and the Present</h3>
<p>None of us have the superpower to return to the past and change memories, and because of the above experience, I&rsquo;ve always been a bit afraid of repeating the same mistakes. I treat those regrets like Pandora&rsquo;s box, with caution. I&rsquo;ve always been used to sealing away these past things, sometimes even for so long that I feel I&rsquo;ve forgotten them, only to find they&rsquo;re still clear when some events or words stir emotions.</p>
<p>Since we&rsquo;re on this topic, I want to tell another story, a long story hidden deep in memory.</p>
<p>After the division into arts and sciences in high school, I entered the arts class, a strange environment. Despite being severely face-blind, I inexplicably remembered a petite girl in the front row at first sight. She had a beautiful smile, and her unique &ldquo;Guess who I am&rdquo; when we first added each other as friends still makes me smile whenever I think of it. A chat during the National Day holiday brought us much closer, and a joking &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call your dormitory&rdquo; made me look forward to every Saturday noon for the next few months. Because we often talked for hours, I would walk along the small path by the canal, the rustling sound of stepping on fallen leaves and the gentleness from the other end of the phone painted the most beautiful autumn in my memory.</p>
<p>Later memories are mainly of companionship, interspersed with some small but warm daily moments: Every time after evening self-study, we would tacitly watch the night sky together in the corridor. Chatting with her as she drank QQ Star milk, trying hard to grow taller, became the happiest time of the day. I remember once overhearing her say that the candied haws brought by a classmate were delicious, but she was too shy to ask. So I walked several streets near the classmate&rsquo;s home address I had inquired about, and finally found the same ones based on the packaging, just to see her surprised yet pretending to be calm expression when I handed them to her. I remember once during a school handicraft fair, I chose a blue wind chime I really liked and wrote her name on it, letting them deliver it to the class, a shy little thought swaying gently with the wind chime. A few months before her 18th birthday, I applied to be a day student, secretly recording birthday wishes from important people around her and audio messages from the whole class, editing them into a video that might seem incredibly crude now but was filled with a lot of heart at the time, just wanting to make this birthday a bit more special in her life&hellip;</p>
<p>It seemed that anything related to her was good.</p>
<p>But the beauty of the world often comes to an abrupt end with regrets, making one sigh at the mercilessness of fate.</p>
<p>After the college entrance exam, we argued, broke up, and deleted each other over something that perhaps now seems resolvable. Although I later asked about her scores and college choices, after much hesitation, I inexplicably avoided all cities related to her. It wasn&rsquo;t until university that I inquired about her situation and restored some contact, but we were no longer who we used to be.</p>
<p>Actually, for so many years, I couldn&rsquo;t calmly tell this story, and I&rsquo;ve always been afraid of those regrets and the emotions they evoke. Until all these memories surged on this sleepless night.</p>
<p>These past beauties and regrets have shaped who I am now. In &ldquo;Proposal Daisakusen&rdquo;, Ken chose to face the present with these memories, while I chose to write them down. The manifestations of courage may differ, but at least, we&rsquo;ve both taken the first step.</p>
<h2 id="other">Other</h2>
<p>This section will record some of my inputs and outputs, as well as other things I find interesting.</p>
<h3 id="work">Work</h3>
<p>This week at work, I was mainly busy with rehearsing for a demonstration, which involves system operation demonstration and explanation for over an hour. It&rsquo;s quite challenging in terms of content arrangement and on-the-spot response, and I can&rsquo;t help feeling a bit nervous. I hope everything goes smoothly when it&rsquo;s official. The rest of the time was spent understanding new projects, I haven&rsquo;t officially started my development tasks yet. In the past, I often had multiple tasks running in parallel, but they were mostly of the same type. This time, because there&rsquo;s a lot that needs additional understanding and learning, I feel a bit overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Other than that, I learned a bit about PostgreSQL, and thought about organizing some commonly used tech stacks or tools in work practice, which can also serve as a reference. Let&rsquo;s consider it an ongoing series (another Flag raised). I wonder when I&rsquo;ll be able to write some in-depth articles more comfortably, still a long way to go.</p>
<h3 id="input">Input</h3>
<h4 id="books">Books</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hackers and Painters</strong>, reading this on my commute. Originally thought it would be some practical content like soft skills, and was reading it as a journey pastime, but surprisingly, many ideas are quite interesting, and the writing style is very comfortable. I&rsquo;m about halfway through and still immersed in it.</li>
<li><strong>I&rsquo;ll Gift You a Bullet</strong>, just started reading, more wanting to learn how to &ldquo;scrutinize&rdquo; the people and things around me.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="tv-series">TV Series</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rehearsal</strong>, when watching the first episode, I was wondering, can the protagonists participating in the rehearsal really enter the role with a new identity? Or what would happen if people involved in the rehearsal gradually can&rsquo;t distinguish between it and reality? It&rsquo;s a short and interesting direction, like telling you from the beginning that this is a performance, less expectation for twists but more easily drawn into the development of events. I was amazed by the age transition coming down the slide, and there are many long shots.</li>
<li><strong>Proposal Daisakusen</strong>, an old drama, rewatched it because of some events this week that reminded me of high school days. The last time I watched it was probably in my freshman or sophomore year of college.</li>
<li><strong>Five Days at Memorial</strong>, talking about medical ethics, curious about how it&rsquo;s handled in such a political environment.</li>
<li><strong>House of the Dragon</strong>, watched another episode, feeling like I might give up soon.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="anime">Anime</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Genius Prince&rsquo;s Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt</strong>, the ensemble feel is very good, with everyone connected around a main storyline. I quite like the line about the manzai comedy duo, reminds me of the Japanese drama &ldquo;Spark&rdquo; I watched a long time ago. Always thought this profession was very interesting.</li>
<li><strong>Summer Time Rendering</strong>, following the series.</li>
<li><strong>My Stepmom&rsquo;s Daughter Is My Ex</strong>, following the series.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a record and reflection of my life from August 22, 2022 to August 28, 2022.</p>
<p>This week, there were finally some changes at work. I entered another project that I&rsquo;m very interested in and more challenging. I feel I can put to use some of the contract and underlying chain-related knowledge I learned while working from home. A colleague I was quite close to left the company mid-week. He joined a week before me, and the first interface I wrote at work was taught by him. Perhaps I&rsquo;m not yet accustomed to farewells, and I feel somewhat sentimental.</p>
<p>On the weekend, I met up with Twitter friend <a href="https://twitter.com/RealAkemiHomura">Homura</a>. He&rsquo;s an interesting and cute boy. We chatted a lot and found many similar ideas and hobbies. It was a delightful experience. Perhaps because I didn&rsquo;t play online games or post much on social media before, I don&rsquo;t seem to be very good at making online friends. This is a small change recently (social phobia recovery therapy), and I&rsquo;ve decided to go out more to take photos and enrich my life.</p>
<p>Additionally, I read quite a few books and gradually got back on track in life. Coincidentally (or perhaps with some inclination), the two books I read this week and the drama I thought of all tell the stories and thoughts of ordinary people. This led to many reflections on being interesting, ordinary, and oneself.</p>
<p>Also, a tweet from <a href="https://twitter.com/Manjusaka_Lee">Manjusaka</a> stirred up some memories and thoughts about charity and kindness.</p>

<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/no_color_people.png" alt="no_color_people"></p>
<p>This title is derived from Haruki Murakami&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="https://book.douban.com/subject/25733470/">Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage</a>&rdquo;, a long and somewhat perplexing name. I came across this book when meeting Humura at a bookstore. I noticed he was reading Murakami&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="https://book.douban.com/subject/30144095/">Kafka on the Shore</a>&rdquo;, which suddenly reminded me that I wanted to catch up on Murakami&rsquo;s books.</p>
<p>When I read &ldquo;<a href="https://book.douban.com/subject/10529920/">1Q84</a>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<a href="https://book.douban.com/subject/27200257/">Norwegian Wood</a>&rdquo; before, I quite liked his writing style. It feels plain yet has a narrative charm, interspersed with some imaginative metaphors. But my favorite is still his miscellaneous essays and notes. Many reflections in &ldquo;<a href="https://book.douban.com/subject/3369600/">What I Talk About When I Talk About Running</a>&rdquo; are thought-provoking. After reading it, I was motivated to keep running for a whole winter break.</p>
<p>The exterior of Wansheng Bookstore in Beijing is quite dilapidated. I had to check the map several times to find the entrance in an inconspicuous place nearby. Inside, bookshelves are everywhere. The arrangement isn&rsquo;t orderly but doesn&rsquo;t lack aesthetic appeal. Following a small corner entrance next to it, I turned a few corners before finding the literature section. &ldquo;A hidden world&rdquo; might be the best description. It&rsquo;s an interesting place that reminds me of many old bookstores in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>I immediately saw the shelf with Murakami&rsquo;s books and randomly chose &ldquo;<a href="https://book.douban.com/subject/25733470/">Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage</a>&rdquo;. I also picked up &ldquo;<a href="https://book.douban.com/subject/26889236/">Novelist as a Vocation</a>&rdquo;. After some hesitation, I decided to read the former first. The perplexing name aroused curiosity, and a novel seemed better for passing the afternoon. After reading a few pages, ah, it&rsquo;s the familiar flavor.</p>
<p>Although I read hastily and don&rsquo;t have the habit of taking notes when reading novels, I still remember a few interesting points. First is the interpretation and exploration of names. When his parents named him, they struggled between &ldquo;Tsukuru&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sou&rdquo;, eventually choosing the former. They hoped he would only need to &ldquo;make&rdquo; rather than bearing the pressure of &ldquo;creating&rdquo;. This already had a good meaning, but because the other four people in his small group and his subsequent close friend&rsquo;s names all coincidentally included color words: &ldquo;red&rdquo;, &ldquo;blue&rdquo;, &ldquo;black&rdquo;, &ldquo;white&rdquo;, &ldquo;gray&rdquo;, it made him feel like he was a characterless existence, along with a colorless life.</p>
<p>Actually, complaints about one&rsquo;s own name are common. In &ldquo;<a href="https://movie.douban.com/subject/26302614/">Reply 1988</a>&rdquo;, Deok-sun also complained to her parents that her name lacked uniqueness, unlike her sister Bora. I once had similar thoughts. My name seemed short and unremarkable, and being a common surname, I often encountered people with the same name in school. Consequently, I often needed to make extra effort to leave more memorable impressions.</p>
<p>Although I&rsquo;ve reconciled with myself later, I still often feel that an interesting life is beyond my reach. I always envy others&rsquo; interesting personalities and experiences, and even when I do well, I only feel like I&rsquo;m fulfilling the duties of my ordinary life or that these achievements don&rsquo;t belong to me. There&rsquo;s a psychological condition called &ldquo;impostor syndrome&rdquo; that seems to aptly describe this point. I saw this mentioned in an article about engineering literacy:</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/imposter_syndrone.jpg" alt="imposter_syndrone"></p>
<p>As age and experiences accumulate, this tendency seems to intensify. The pursuit of being interesting has become an elusive obsession, but even when others comment that I&rsquo;m a person with rich experiences or interesting, I&rsquo;m always skeptical. Tsukuru Tazaki in the book seems to be in a similar state. He&rsquo;s actually doing the station construction work he&rsquo;s always been interested in, yet still feels he&rsquo;s missing something, attributing it to his lack of color.</p>
<p>People seem to have a tendency to form groups at various stages, and once dependent on a group, one inevitably suffers pressure and setbacks from relationships. In college, I once had such a group of four, two boys and two girls. We were inseparable, and when the counselor or classmates found someone missing, they would naturally ask the others.</p>
<p>But after a while, I felt obvious pressure. The other three seemed to be more prominent figures, always the shining ones in the crowd, while I seemed to always lack presence. Yet internally, I didn&rsquo;t want to be the redundant one who was part of it out of habit. So I started deliberately avoiding and escaping, but of course, my clumsy performance couldn&rsquo;t hide it, and it was quickly noticed.</p>
<p>I can say I was luckier than Tsukuru Tazaki. I wasn&rsquo;t abandoned, and there were no misunderstandings. The other three cornered me at the entrance of the boys&rsquo; dormitory one night, asking me to reveal my inner conflicts, and then resolved them one by one. Regarding the response to personality and presence, I might still think it was just comfort, but I felt that I was needed in this relationship and pattern, that my emotions were taken seriously by them, that our relationship was cherished. Even though we later had few opportunities for joint action due to cities and many reasons, we still maintain good contact, and they&rsquo;re the first people I think of when visiting any member&rsquo;s city.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently in another three-person relationship, two close friends from junior high school. By definition, they might not count as childhood friends, but we&rsquo;re closer than that. Because we&rsquo;re separated in three places, I often think about the foundation, direction, and balance of this relationship. Although there will be some changes gradually, and there are many parts we need to face in the future, I&rsquo;m gradually willing to work hard for it and explore more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<a href="https://book.douban.com/subject/26425831/">Stoner</a>&rdquo; actually also describes a lot about the ordinariness of life and the perfection of personality. However, the topic is quite broad, and I might talk about it later along with &ldquo;<a href="https://movie.douban.com/subject/33477335/">Normal People</a>&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="kindness-and-charity">Kindness and Charity</h2>
<p>Last week, I saw a tweet from <a href="https://twitter.com/Manjusaka_Lee">Manjusaka</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A piece of good news to share with everyone</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A student from the Daliangshan area, whom my sister and I have been supporting together, has successfully been admitted to a decent public college in the eastern coastal area. It&rsquo;s considered the first step of stepping out. Although for many people, a college might not be worth mentioning, for children from Daliangshan, this step already requires too much effort</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Welcome everyone to join in supporting students, after all</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>#Education is the best public welfare</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later, I learned about the &ldquo;<a href="http://www.one-school.org">One Village One School</a>&rdquo; organization and plan to follow up and support a student one-on-one in the future.</p>
<p>Actually, I find it hard to ascribe the noble meaning of &ldquo;charity&rdquo; to these actions of mine. I&rsquo;ve had times when I used them as a boast or topic of conversation.</p>
<p>The year I finished the college entrance exam, I went with close friends to a mountain village in Hunan for volunteer teaching. We participated in some activities, taught some classes, met a group of lovely children, and then hurriedly left. Later, when university started, there was a discussion about volunteer teaching in the class group. At that time, I talked about this experience (perhaps with some hidden pride, &ldquo;Look! I&rsquo;ve done such things&rdquo;). A classmate&rsquo;s reply left a deep impression on me. I can&rsquo;t remember the exact words, but the gist was questioning whether I had ever thought about how these waves of volunteer teachers seemed to go with their own purposes to let those children see the outside world, give them more imagination and warmth, yet hurriedly leave, probably never to return to this place, their lives never to intersect again. Compared to this briefly transmitted so-called &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo;, whether the benefits outweigh the harm.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember the subsequent discussions, but I imagine I must have said something like &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go see them again if I have the chance&rdquo; with lingering attachment to those children. That was in 2015. Seven years have passed, and I&rsquo;ve never been back. She was right.</p>
<p>Afterwards, I became very cautious about such things and no longer dared to call it charity, fearing that I would do such self-satisfying things out of vanity. In my memory, I only gave a little more than usual when the department&rsquo;s volunteer teaching team called for donations to buy winter clothes.</p>
<p>This time, seeing Manjusaka&rsquo;s tweet, I felt genuinely happy and hope I can do more in this way too.</p>
<h2 id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h2>
<p>This section will record my input and output, as well as other things I find interesting.</p>
<h3 id="input">Input</h3>
<h4 id="books">Books</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Work, Consumerism and the New Poor</strong>, whether in the era of work ethics or later consumerism, even with the addition of grandiose terms like ethics and morality, the poor have always been merely a symbol and never viewed as a group. The constantly changing rules and orders, or different attitudes, are just the ways each society chooses to prefer or allow at that stage. Even when value is given to the poor, it&rsquo;s nothing more than condescending charity.</li>
<li><strong>The Nine-Grid Writing Method</strong>, a small book, concise and with an attractive writing style. Previously, I&rsquo;ve always disliked such &ldquo;how to read/write&rdquo; books, but after starting to update my blog, I often feel the limitations of expression methods. It&rsquo;s very inspiring, especially in information collection and organization. In my practice, combined with Logseq&rsquo;s daily recording of various ideas, it can add a lot of ideas for writing.</li>
<li><strong>Stoner</strong>, I read it hastily in high school, but rereading it recently gave me many new feelings. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s because the setting is all about literature majors, but while reading, I was reminded of &ldquo;Normal People&rdquo;, a popular drama from a couple of years ago. Perhaps an ordinary person&rsquo;s life is always so trivial and real, with studies, love, and marriage all full of a sense of brokenness, unable to change yet living earnestly. Recently, I&rsquo;ve come to like more and more this plain life under simple strokes and the attitude towards life it conveys. Perhaps I&rsquo;m getting old too (although it sounds a bit affected to say so).</li>
<li><strong>Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage</strong>, a rare physical book I&rsquo;ve read in one sitting recently. Murakami&rsquo;s words often have this magic, seemingly just describing some trivial matters and mental clutter, yet attracting people to explore the connections between various elements. This book is mainly about the breakdown of friendship and loss. I can&rsquo;t help but think of the three-person small group I&rsquo;m in. Perhaps I, who have placed too much dependence, can no longer bear the cost of loss. It&rsquo;s just that as life and time pass, we have more to face.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="tv-series">TV Series</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Five Days at Memorial</strong>, watched more than half, talking about some events during Hurricane Katrina in the US, inevitably reminds me of some things during the Wuhan epidemic</li>
<li><strong>House of the Dragon</strong>, prequel to Game of Thrones, watched one episode so far, general impression is average</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="movies">Movies</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Return to Dust</strong>, the first feeling reminds me of Nomadland, followed by To Live. The rain scene is both moving and heartbreaking, silently praying that hardships won&rsquo;t befall, yet to no avail. But in the two hours of quiet viewing, there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be much trace of exaggerating suffering in terms of viewing experience. Perhaps this is the true face of Chinese people&rsquo;s suffering itself, generation after generation repeating the same mistakes.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="anime">Anime</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Summer Time Rendering</strong>, even reluctant for it to end, rare to still be looking forward to subsequent developments after 20 episodes, hope it doesn&rsquo;t have a bad ending</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="games">Games</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Octopath Traveler</strong>, played a bit on weekday nights during leisure time, the high-definition pixel art experience is quite good</li>
<li><strong>Disco Elysium</strong>, was sick this week, so didn&rsquo;t play</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>This is a record of and reflection on my life from August 16 to August 21, 2022. Work remained relatively relaxed this week, allowing for more time to converse and dine with colleagues midweek. With limited time at home, the overall pace was leisurely. The atmosphere of July and August felt reminiscent of summer vacations past, unburdened by any sense of guilt. Nevertheless, I managed to read some books and establish a more regular reading routine in terms of time, frequency, and approach.</p>
<p>Midweek, I experienced some disheartening events in my emotional life (perhaps it can no longer be called a relationship, but rather memories). After a few days of adjustment, I&rsquo;ve recovered somewhat. I&rsquo;m concerned about my state of mind and have been seriously contemplating whether I should (again) adopt a cat.</p>
<h2 id="career-musings">Career Musings</h2>
<p>Last week, I listened to the episode &ldquo;<a href="https://pan.icu/65">65. Kernel Panic × Fengyanfengyu: What would we do if we weren&rsquo;t programmers?</a>&rdquo; and found it quite thought-provoking. Unlike the guests, my journey into programming was more of a serendipitous occurrence. In my relatively short life thus far, I&rsquo;ve experienced several turning points, like different world lines, and I often wonder if another version of myself in a parallel universe is happier or equally perplexed.</p>
<p>In truth, I&rsquo;ve never harbored grand ambitions. As a child, I never dreamed of becoming &ldquo;X scientist.&rdquo; More realistically, I once considered becoming a teacher, but after spending several years with an unkind elementary school homeroom teacher, I lost much of my enthusiasm. It&rsquo;s not that I think teaching is a poor profession; I simply feared becoming that kind of adult.</p>
<p>In high school, as I read and wrote more, I entertained dreams of becoming an independent writer or journalist. Perhaps there was a touch of naive righteousness and heroism, but overall, I had no grandiose or noble ideas like &ldquo;revitalizing Chinese literature&rdquo; or &ldquo;exposing social ills.&rdquo; I simply thought how wonderful it would be to combine my hobby of reading and writing with my profession.</p>
<p>After the college entrance exam, I participated in an international volunteer teaching program where I met real international journalists, which further shaped my imagination of future careers. However, as I grew older, I gradually realized that I lacked the imagination to become a writer and the courage to be a journalist. This is perhaps the price of growing up - no longer being able to loudly proclaim one&rsquo;s so-called &ldquo;ideals&rdquo; and having to acknowledge and face one&rsquo;s limitations.</p>
<p>Being assigned to the English major was fortunate in a way, as it didn&rsquo;t make me feel like I was wasting time during my period of uncertainty about the future. In my first two years of university, I didn&rsquo;t think much about the future. Instead, I spent my free time learning various software like Photoshop and Premiere, actively participating in various student organizations, and being the &ldquo;tech geek&rdquo; in the liberal arts college.</p>
<p>The logic behind most software isn&rsquo;t complex; it&rsquo;s a matter of practice makes perfect. Gradually, an idea formed: rather than just &ldquo;using&rdquo; software, wouldn&rsquo;t &ldquo;creating&rdquo; it be more interesting? So I started learning to code with Python. I took many detours, experiencing months of only being able to do homework exercises without creating complete projects. It&rsquo;s only now, after much exploration, that I&rsquo;ve barely scratched the surface.</p>
<p>At that time, I didn&rsquo;t consider it as a career goal; I simply thought I was doing something interesting and cool. In my junior year, on a whim, I started learning photography. I bought a Sony A7M3 mirrorless camera (which I still use today) and began documenting landscapes and human interest stories while on business trips during my internship.</p>
<p>The mentor who taught me photography was a deep journalist and documentary director. He didn&rsquo;t teach me basic composition principles or how to adjust parameters. Instead, he subtly conveyed that even for a simple photograph, one must conceive a theme in mind when shooting, like telling a subtle story. All composition, tone, or effects should serve this story. This perspective continues to influence me.</p>
<p>After my internship, I returned to school and opened my own video studio, taking on promotional video and online course production and editing projects. Starting from lighting, scene setting, green screen, and so on, I experienced various aspects of the industry with a minimal workflow. I did consider making it my profession, but ultimately felt it lacked sufficient interest, so I abandoned the idea.</p>
<p>As graduation approached, I consistently considered becoming a product manager. I learned about and experienced some related work, but still felt my interest lay in &ldquo;creating&rdquo; and the satisfaction of truly completing something, rather than designing and outlining blueprints (while still feeling I lacked sufficient creativity). So I didn&rsquo;t pursue that path either.</p>
<p>Finally, I went abroad to study in a different field and returned to become a fairly competent programmer. This is my current career path. Although there are many aspects I&rsquo;ve glossed over, I&rsquo;ve genuinely experienced confusion, struggle, dejection, and various other emotions at each stage. Being able to reach this point involves both luck and the rewards of effort, which I deeply cherish. I can&rsquo;t be certain I&rsquo;ll always be a programmer, but it will likely always be related to coding in some way, as it&rsquo;s the most interesting thing I&rsquo;ve done so far, with endless room for exploration. The story continues, and who doesn&rsquo;t want to experience a more diverse and interesting lifestyle?</p>
<h2 id="404-not-found">404 Not Found</h2>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/dino.gif" alt="dino"></p>
<p>This might be a somewhat cryptic title.</p>
<p>On websites, if content no longer exists, a &ldquo;404 Not Found&rdquo; page is usually displayed to notify visitors. I&rsquo;ve always found this quite cool. I once chose a 404 icon style for the bag I carry my power bank in, and for a while, I added Google&rsquo;s little dinosaur animation to my introduction page (Google Chrome browser has an offline jumping game when there&rsquo;s a problem accessing a website, giving visitors some entertainment while they wait).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always considered myself a person with a high error tolerance, able to face small mistakes and mishaps calmly or even jokingly, often proud of this attitude. Until my relationship became 404 Not Found.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/misty_blog_404_not_found.png" alt="misty_blog_404_not_found"></p>
<p>In truth, I wasn&rsquo;t blind to the signs of being cleared out or disassociated, and I was gradually accepting some realities as time passed. But when the 404 prompt appeared before my eyes, I discovered the pain was much stronger than I had imagined, tearing open the facade of strength I had been maintaining for so many days.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been more optimistic about relationships compared to other aspects of life. Now I have to acknowledge the inherent tragic nature of relationships. The former sweetness has become a thorny cage constraining me now. Not touching it means not getting hurt, but it also means losing the courage to step forward.</p>
<h2 id="cats">Cats</h2>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/my_cat_xiao_shu.jpg" alt="my_cat_xiao_shu"></p>
<p>To be honest, before being with her, I had never thought about keeping a cat. I probably felt that someone who couldn&rsquo;t even take care of themselves had no right to be responsible for another living being. But when we actually had a new family member, I gradually discovered that I enjoyed this dependence and being depended upon, and life seemed to have many more goals.</p>
<p>After she left, Xiao Shu was taken away too. Although I often jokingly tell friends that I&rsquo;ve lost &ldquo;both person and cat,&rdquo; I know that my care wasn&rsquo;t as good as hers before, so this choice is understandable. It&rsquo;s just that every time I recall the past, I feel twice as sad.</p>
<p>After watching the documentary &ldquo;<a href="http://movie.douban.com/subject/36033619/">The Secret World of Cats</a>&rdquo; last night, I learned more about many thoughts and interaction details of cats that I had previously overlooked. It vaguely sparked the idea of whether I should raise a cat again. However, this feels like a betrayal to Xiao Shu, and I&rsquo;m still not mentally prepared to properly care for a new member. Welcoming a new member when I&rsquo;m in need is hardly a responsible choice for either the cat or myself.</p>
<p>Perhaps someday in the future.</p>
<h2 id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h2>
<p>This section will record some of my inputs, outputs, and other things I find interesting.</p>
<h3 id="learning">Learning</h3>
<p>This week, I continued to follow the plan and watch some learning course materials. I finally caught up with the smart contract courses (32 hours, so long!). However, because I&rsquo;m already familiar with contracts, and there&rsquo;s a lot of repetitive code, I rarely followed along and wrote directly. I plan to analyze the project source code this week, so the amount of code in these two weeks has been pitifully small. I&rsquo;m almost becoming a Markdown engineer.</p>
<h3 id="blog-related">Blog Related</h3>
<p>The previous article I wrote about Stablecoin still needs some modifications, but I haven&rsquo;t made the changes yet due to my state in the latter half of the period. I need to adjust and improve it in the next few days. This week, I&rsquo;ll continue to complete the following blog posts (which I&rsquo;ve been procrastinating on for a long time):</p>
<ol>
<li>Cosmos Principles and Architecture</li>
<li>Docker Basics and Practice</li>
<li>k8s Basics and Practice</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="input">Input</h3>
<h4 id="books">Books</h4>
<p>This week, I dug out my long-forgotten Kindle Oasis 2, cleaned up the account and book categories, leaving only &ldquo;To Read,&rdquo; &ldquo;Reading,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Read&rdquo; categories, basically synchronized with Douban. This way, I can read for about 50 minutes during my commute every day, and sometimes a bit at home. It&rsquo;s more immersive and easier on the eyes than reading e-books on my phone.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tim Cook: The Genius Who Took Apple to the Next Level</strong>, finished reading. The book is ordinary, feeling more like a pile of information, but it did help me understand more about post-Jobs Apple and the values it practices.</li>
<li><strong>Work, Consumerism and the New Poor</strong>, an interesting book. I&rsquo;ve read two chapters, and it&rsquo;s quite inspiring for my recent thoughts on work status.</li>
<li><strong>The Grid Writing Method</strong>, <a href="https://lutaonan.com/blog/read-grid-writing-method/">a small book recommended by Randy</a>, I&rsquo;ll read it this week.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="tv-series">TV Series</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Extraordinary Attorney Woo</strong>, I initially started watching this drama after seeing a clip and finding the female lead cute, but surprisingly, I&rsquo;ve been following it weekly to the end. An autistic lawyer is quite a new perspective, and commendably, it doesn&rsquo;t just focus on the female lead&rsquo;s fortune but also includes cases related to other autistic individuals. The main plot isn&rsquo;t extensive, but the relationship between the male and female leads is refreshingly natural.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="movies">Movies</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Small Remembrance</strong>, Although I&rsquo;m not yet at the stage where I can calmly watch romance movies, I did immerse myself in this one. I could see some scenes and appearances similar to those described in &ldquo;A Bouquet,&rdquo; but with less deliberate emphasis on fate and sentimentality, and more of the past and present entanglements fused into words and gestures. Additionally, the late-night Japanese street scenes completely fulfilled all my fantasies about beautiful fate. I want to go there.</li>
<li><strong>The Secret World of Cats</strong>, I gained some understanding of cats&rsquo; thoughts and could feel the pain of having owned a cat and then being separated from it. I&rsquo;m considering adopting a cat again after I adjust a bit (there&rsquo;s always some inexplicable feeling of betrayal).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="anime">Anime</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Arcane: League of Legends</strong>, I wanted to watch it when it first came out but only caught up now. It&rsquo;s the pinnacle of animation I&rsquo;ve seen in recent years in terms of visuals, plot, pacing, and soundtrack. Although I don&rsquo;t play League of Legends and might miss some emotional connections to the characters and storylines, I could still see a great story and a matching grand worldview. Looking forward to the next season.</li>
<li><strong>Summer Time Rendering</strong>, It&rsquo;s getting more and more exciting.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="games">Games</h4>
<p>I suddenly discovered that Douban also has a feature to record games. I modified my n8n automation script and added the function of synchronizing game records. In the future, I also want to add some relaxing elements to my daily life.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Disco Elysium</strong>, It&rsquo;s a famous literary game from the past two years, created by several writers. I played a bit on Steam before, but the record wasn&rsquo;t saved. Recently, I bought the Switch cartridge version to play properly and also as a collection. I&rsquo;ve played for about two or three hours and am attracted by the art style and the thoughts behind it. I&rsquo;ll play slowly and might write something about it.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>This is a record and reflection of my life from <code>2022-08-08</code> to <code>2022-08-15</code>. This week&rsquo;s work still revolved around preparing for an evaluation of the project, mainly focusing on explaining the proposal. Work hours were relatively normal, and I gradually regained a good life rhythm.</p>
<p>However, I felt that after getting used to staying at home after work, I lacked the motivation to go out. The planned skateboarding practice and night runs were put on hold. Compared to before, I did go out a few times - dinner gatherings on some weekday evenings, a trip to Nanluoguxiang on the weekend, and an evening stroll at Shichahai. I&rsquo;ve always thought this place name was beautiful, and finally got to see it.</p>
<p>After last week&rsquo;s adjustment, I scheduled quite a few learning plans this week and decided to validate my learning by taking a certification exam, which is also a form of external motivation. Besides that, I chatted with a few friends about work adjustments, remote work, and career pursuits.</p>
<h2 id="learning-and-certification">Learning and Certification</h2>
<p>In my previous two work projects, I frequently used Docker and Kubernetes, and I&rsquo;m quite familiar with their basic commands and configuration file writing. However, I never had a systematic study of their architecture and technical details. Last week, I watched some explanations on the YouTube channel &ldquo;<a href="https://www.techworld-with-nana.com">TechWorld with Nana</a>&rdquo;, which filled in many knowledge gaps.</p>
<p>But because Kubernetes involves so many components and operations, it&rsquo;s easy to forget if not used for a while, and it&rsquo;s not conducive to memory without hands-on practice. Moreover, I&rsquo;m very interested in the DevOps field and often tinker with some automation tools and serverless applications. So I decided to study more systematically and take the Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD) certification, a certification project jointly developed by CNCF and the Linux Foundation. This project is mainly aimed at developers and covers many knowledge points:</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/ckad_topics.png" alt="ckad_topics"></p>
<p>What&rsquo;s special is that this certification exam ends with 19 hands-on practical questions, and you can also check the official Kubernetes documentation. There&rsquo;s nothing that needs to be memorized by rote, which is very suitable for testing learning outcomes. I bought the &ldquo;<a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/certified-kubernetes-application-developer/">Kubernetes Certified Application Developer (CKAD) with Tests</a>&rdquo; course on the Udemy platform, and I&rsquo;ve been immersed in doing the Labs it comes with recently. Because it&rsquo;s an online environment, it&rsquo;s very convenient, reminiscent of the feeling of rushing to finish assignments before deadlines back in school.</p>
<p>Actually, I seemed to have taken quite a few certifications in college. One that left a deep impression was an intermediate software qualification (Software Designer) certificate. Because it had a theoretical comprehensive exam in the morning and a practical exam in the afternoon, with a pass rate of less than 30%, I was very nervous when I first registered. I bought books and various materials early on, but I kept procrastinating until only half a month was left before I started urgent revision and practice questions, finally passing with a borderline score. Because I wasn&rsquo;t majoring in CS in college, the deepest experience from that exam was gaining a systematic understanding of software engineering, operating systems, computer organization principles, and various programming languages during the preparation process, which provided a lot of help for my later cross-disciplinary studies.</p>
<p>Later, because my undergraduate major was English, I also took TEM-4, TEM-8, IELTS, etc. I increasingly realized the importance of learning goals and plans for understanding a new field or mastering new knowledge. Similar to the previously mentioned mode of learning oriented towards weekly reviews or blogs, having an output standard makes the learning process more systematic and the thought process clearer. The most recent ones should be CKAD and Japanese N2. I can explore others further (though some certifications are really expensive).</p>
<h2 id="work-and-state-adjustment">Work and State Adjustment</h2>
<p>This week, I chatted with two friends about work-related matters. One is changing jobs and came to learn about some web3-related information. The other has been working in a web3 team for the past few months. I interviewed them about their thoughts on work, which I found very enviable and interesting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;You can meet more passionate/interesting people&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t take naps anymore, I&rsquo;m more willing to do my work well, it doesn&rsquo;t even feel like work&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It emphasizes initiative, while also being challenging&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Fewer meetings, more freedom, sometimes I write code until one or two in the morning without realizing it, a long-lost feeling&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can feel their passion and expectations between the lines. Besides being a tool for making a living, they have their own pursuits and ideas about the work atmosphere, mode, and content, which has greatly influenced my definition and standards for future work.</p>
<p>My learning and work state have improved in the past few days, but sleep is still somewhat problematic. I often have intermittent dreams, mixed with many past memories, so real that it&rsquo;s hard to recover even after waking up. It&rsquo;s time to start booking for the physical examination, I want to complete it in August.</p>
<h2 id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h2>
<p>This section will record some of my input and output, as well as other things I find interesting.</p>
<h3 id="learning">Learning</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, this week was mainly about learning DevOps and preparing for CKAD. At the same time, I did some learning and recording on automatic deployment and operation and maintenance tools such as GitLab CI/CD, GitHub Action, Ansible, etc., which are still being organized.</p>
<p>In addition, I picked up photo editing (Adobe Photoshop + Affinity Photo) and video editing (Final Cut Pro X + Davinci Resolve) skills again, and started to slowly re-plan some of my life records.</p>
<h3 id="blog-related">Blog Related</h3>
<p>After keeping my Sspai editor waiting for more than a month (and leaving messages on read), I finally had a pang of conscience and finished the draft of the previously commissioned article about Stablecoin and sent it over. After some revisions and additions based on feedback, it will be ready. I feel like a huge weight has been lifted off my chest.</p>
<p>The article I wrote before, &ldquo;<a href="https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2022/07/05/access_your_local_devices_using_reverse_proxy_tool_frp/">Thin Client Development Workflow Based on frp Intranet Penetration</a>&rdquo;, was finally published this week and included in the <a href="https://sspai.com/prime/story/thin-client-solution-with-frp">member-exclusive</a> content, which is a small achievement.</p>
<p>The remaining plan is to complete the following blog posts this week (maybe more notes on practice):</p>
<ol>
<li>Cosmos Principles and Architecture</li>
<li>Docker Basics and Practice</li>
<li>Kubernetes Basics and Practice</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="input">Input</h3>
<h4 id="books">Books</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tim Cook: The Genius Who Took Apple to the Next Level</strong>, almost finished, feeling a deeper understanding of the philosophy behind Apple products</li>

<li><strong>Extraordinary Attorney Woo</strong>, it&rsquo;s starting to get emotional, with some plot conflicts emerging, and the little whale is really cute</li>
<li><strong>Stone and Cocco: Is it Okay to File a Case Like This?</strong>, a new Japanese drama, also in the legal genre. Actually, I&rsquo;m not very impressed with the male lead&rsquo;s character setting, but because the female lead is Kasumi Arimura, there&rsquo;s a reason to watch</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="movies">Movies</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Decision to Leave</strong>, the cinematography and overall rhythm are very comfortable. The description of crime and psychology occupies the vast majority, but there&rsquo;s a lack of presentation in plot development and mental changes. The fun part is finding various uses of Apple devices in it</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="anime">Anime</h4>

<li><strong>Summer Time Rendering</strong>, continuing to wait for the development of the later plot</li>
<li><strong>My Stepmom&rsquo;s Daughter is My Ex</strong>, I quite like this kind of romance anime</li>

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/yu_switch_games.jpg" alt="yu_switch_games"></p>
<p>This piece is a record and reflection of my life from <code>2022-08-01</code> to <code>2022-08-07</code>. In terms of work rhythm, it was far from busy, and I even got home as early as 7 p.m. on several days, which was rare. The extra leisure time allowed me to think more about my personality and state of life, and to organize many previously scattered thoughts.</p>
<h2 id="sincerity">Sincerity</h2>
<p>Over the weekend, I learned that a close friend was facing interpersonal relationship difficulties. We reviewed and analyzed the causes together, involving aspects such as personality, individual temperament, communication, and thinking patterns. The core factor running through it all was &ldquo;sincerity&rdquo;. Combined with my reflections on interpersonal relationships and communication from the past few weeks, I&rsquo;d like to share some of my thoughts.</p>
<h3 id="the-dilemma-of-interpersonal-relationships">The Dilemma of Interpersonal Relationships</h3>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve grown older and been influenced by the traits internalized in my personality, I quite enjoy giving to others, especially those close to me, and I believe I&rsquo;ve practiced this in my past experiences. But some events that occurred later made me gradually realize that I seem to have always drawn very clear boundaries in interpersonal relationships: family, lovers, close friends, other friends, people I won&rsquo;t become close to, strangers, and so on. Although there may not be much subjective consciousness or utilitarian consideration, there are always hidden priorities. In the vast majority of communications with others, I may have only achieved authenticity or avoided being hypocritical and sycophantic, while often finding it difficult to take the step towards true sincerity.</p>
<p>From the perspective of so-called social standards or positive feedback obtained from others, it seems to be quite sufficient. This often makes me question whether there is such an inherent line when people first get to know each other. It&rsquo;s not difficult to reach this line, and being friendly seems to already meet the foundation for establishing almost all relationships. However, to cross this line requires exponentially more effort, and I often stop at this point. It seems that when reaching a certain critical moment, there&rsquo;s a voice telling me that what needs to be done for this relationship is just this much, and it&rsquo;s enough.</p>
<h3 id="self">Self</h3>
<p>A later argument with a close friend made me realize the self-righteousness and self-satisfaction hidden behind this way of thinking, which even subtly influenced my behavior and thinking priorities. After realizing this, I went through some adjustments and changes. I gradually became less concerned about the balance of mutual contributions and began to consciously consider what others need and what I can do in my interactions with them. Whether in communication or getting along, I took an extra step beyond my previous habits and received some sincere feedback. However, I still feel that it&rsquo;s difficult to achieve sincerity well in my inner heart.</p>
<h3 id="reflections-on-sincerity">Reflections on Sincerity</h3>
<p>Perhaps due to insecurity and inner defensiveness, I often feel that a large part of others&rsquo; friendliness towards me is an equivalent reciprocation of my friendly attitude. And in my own heart, there are actually many indifferent factors. I can&rsquo;t always wholeheartedly dedicate myself with full enthusiasm. Sometimes I feel like an outsider observer, watching my own actions and the corresponding feedback they receive, and in the process, achieving my &ldquo;optimization&rdquo; in interactions with others.</p>
<p>To say there&rsquo;s any malice or utilitarian purpose wouldn&rsquo;t be accurate, but when examining myself, there are always some strange thoughts. Over time, it becomes difficult to feel the sincere parts in others&rsquo; words or feedback, and it&rsquo;s hard to distinguish whether it&rsquo;s out of gratitude or pure emotion without preconceptions.</p>
<p>Gradually, I became able to let my guard down only with these objects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Close friends who have always accompanied me and are treated as family</li>
<li>The object of my unreserved devotion in romantic relationships</li>
<li>Friends who have gone through difficult times together (possibly bad states, emotional breakdowns, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, the commonality is that I have actively shown my extremely vulnerable, sensitive, or bad side in front of them, yet was trusted and accepted, making me realize at some stage that I relied on such sincere companionship. Perhaps I&rsquo;m too strict about this point, or I&rsquo;m no longer accustomed to investing too much sincerity in a new relationship. I always feel that I&rsquo;m becoming more and more negative and slow in my emotions, and often no longer have more expectations. This is also the biggest dilemma I&rsquo;m currently facing. The reflection and discussion about sincerity and getting along continue, and I hope there can be some alleviation.</p>
<h2 id="games">Games</h2>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/yu_game_gallery.png" alt="yu_game_gallery"></p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t actually play any games this week, but I want to talk about &ldquo;games&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Games are both familiar and unfamiliar to me. As a child, I was a die-hard Nintendo fan. A GameBoy and a few Pokémon (it was called Pocket Monsters back then) cartridges accompanied me through almost my entire childhood. I completed every version countless times and knew every in-game collection like the back of my hand. Even in middle and high school, I often revisited those classics through emulators, playing early versions of the Zelda and Fire Emblem series.</p>
<p>After entering university, I completely lost interest in games. I only played one bot match in the ever-popular League of Legends and never logged in again. I didn&rsquo;t catch the Overwatch craze, and later games like Hearthstone and Honor of Kings were only briefly tried before being abandoned. At gatherings, my response of &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not very good at it&rdquo; to invitations to play Honor of Kings together always caught people off guard.</p>
<p>I always felt there were more important things to do, or feared the guilt of immersing myself in games. I was able to avoid contact for a long time, and gradually lost interest, until the appearance of the Nintendo Switch in 2017. I seemed to rediscover my passion for the gaming world, <a href="https://pseudoyu.notion.site/f5f9e6e31b4744a7a1284eaf55451462?v=6e3be0ced2f44305b9ff3a8298e72de5">hoarded many games</a>, immersed myself in Hyrule completely forgetting <del>Zelda&rsquo;s</del> Link&rsquo;s mission, hatched eggs day and night in Pokémon Sword and Shield to cultivate my team, pondered over strategy for a whole night for a limited item in Fire Emblem: Three Houses&hellip;</p>
<p>Games have actually brought a lot. I lost a cup of Starbucks because of a guess about whether she was playing Changge or Wanhua in JX3, which was the beginning of our relationship. We caught Eevee together every day in Pokémon Go, completed daily tasks and gyms, and gained a lot of happiness. Later, our daily routine became her playing JX3 and me playing Pokémon, and we both ended up playing dress-up games. Gradually, the joy of games was no longer confined to the game design itself, but in the daily life embedded within.</p>
<p>Now I often want to pick up the controller and play something, constantly switching between games, but I find it hard to muster the courage to start, having lost that mindset.</p>
<h2 id="state-adjustment">State Adjustment</h2>
<p>This week&rsquo;s work was still on the preparation of the previous project. Because I was already very familiar with this part of the architecture and code, the workload was very controllable, so I was able to finish relatively early.</p>
<p>But even though I had some free time, I still felt that internal consumption was quite serious. Actually, I&rsquo;ve started to slowly think about the nature and gains of work recently, and I also talked about this with a newly acquainted undergraduate junior who I feel a connection with. Although I gained a lot of improvement in the initial stage of work, which was a necessary phase, because it&rsquo;s not what I really want to do or am interested in, but one external demand after another, lacking the positive feedback brought by a sense of achievement, I can only compensate for this part from my blog posts or other learning outputs.</p>
<p>These days I can basically get home after 7 p.m., giving me a lot more time to dispose of as I wish, but for the first few days after getting home, I felt a bit at a loss and couldn&rsquo;t make good use of it or relax properly. Humura gave me a lot of suggestions after my last weekly review, especially regarding exercise and sleep, but there was very limited room for adjustment this week, and my sleep condition even worsened after stopping melatonin (having finished two bottles).</p>
<p>The time arrangement for the latter few days improved a lot, but sleep still didn&rsquo;t improve. I feel I need more self-discipline to adjust my state. The self-discipline mentioned here is not about focusing on work or study, but more strictly dividing my time, ensuring a balance between work and rest, entertainment, and exercise in my work and study in a regular way, rather than a period of activeness + a period of depression. I might even need to find some subtle motivation or expectation for myself every day, such as taking some daily videos or cultivating some simple habits.</p>
<h2 id="learning-and-input">Learning and Input</h2>
<p>This section will record some interesting things I&rsquo;ve found and some progress in work and study.</p>
<h3 id="technical-learning">Technical Learning</h3>
<p>This week I read quite a few books and tutorials outside of work. I&rsquo;ve used a lot of Docker and k8s operations in my work before, and have some understanding of basic operations, but I haven&rsquo;t systematically understood their principles and advanced usage. I found a great channel &ldquo;<a href="https://www.techworld-with-nana.com">TechWorld with Nana</a>&rdquo;, which explains things very clearly and practically.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve completely studied the architecture and core mechanisms of Cosmos once, and I&rsquo;m drawing some diagrams to organize it. The first project after starting work was based on Cosmos development for nearly half a year, but I always had a half-understanding of its underlying principles. I&rsquo;ve finally filled in some of the gaps I had at that time and studied it properly.</p>
<h3 id="blog-related">Blog Related</h3>
<p>I previously came across a learning concept based on blogging or teaching, which is to learn a new knowledge point with the standard of being able to teach others or make readers understand better. With this premise, I can more clearly define my learning goals. Based on this, I&rsquo;ve planned several blog posts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cosmos Principles and Architecture</li>
<li>Docker Basics and Practice</li>
<li>k8s Basics and Practice</li>
</ol>
<p>I need to spend more time on writing next week.</p>
<h3 id="input">Input</h3>
<h4 id="books">Books</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tim Cook: The Genius Who Took Apple to the Next Level</strong>, I was quite surprised by Tim&rsquo;s childhood and some of his views</li>
<li><strong>Blockchain Architecture and Implementation: Cosmos Explained</strong>, I read it because of work, the first four chapters are quite good, explaining the entire architecture, especially the consensus algorithm, in detail. I plan to look at the source code for the later detailed chapters when I need to use them as reference material</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="tv-series">TV Series</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Genius Game</strong>, Lei Jiayin&rsquo;s acting is very good, and Zhang Zifeng is also a pleasant surprise. As I watched further, I found the parallel universe setting similar to &ldquo;Someday or One Day&rdquo;, but the logic and worldview are far inferior, and the plot and character development are a bit frustrating</li>
<li><strong>Extraordinary Attorney Woo</strong>, looking forward to new episodes every week</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="anime">Anime</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Summer Time Rendering</strong>, getting more and more exciting</li>
<li><strong>My Stepmom&rsquo;s Daughter Is My Ex</strong>, watched several episodes in a row, quite relaxing</li>
</ul>

<p>This piece is a record and reflection of my life from July 25, 2022, to July 31, 2022, also the first week back to work after a vacation.</p>
<p>After experiencing a rare &ldquo;short summer break,&rdquo; I was immediately thrust into the tense preparation of a new project before I had time to adjust my state, which also prompted me to think more about the balance between work and life.</p>
<h2 id="work-and-sense-of-time-control">Work and Sense of Time Control</h2>
<p>As I mentioned in a previous article, it has been a year since I ended my student life and entered the workforce. Thanks to the training under extreme pressure from the first project, I have mostly mastered my work responsibilities. Even when faced with impromptu meetings or technical proposal explanations, I can handle them with relative ease.</p>
<p>The greatest advantage of being trusted at work is having a good degree of freedom. As long as I can coordinate and arrange the progress of the entire task well and achieve a good result, there is no need to succumb to meaningless competition. The working hours are fairly normal, and the work pressure of most projects is not particularly high for long periods (mainly because it is B2B business, so we mostly rush to meet delivery milestones). I can also use the saved time to learn other things.</p>
<p>I originally thought this mode was quite good, but recently my state has slowly developed some problems. It feels as if my life is slowly being devoured.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t been able to control the leisure time after work as well as I had originally envisioned. As the days go by, I tend to engage in more mindless leisure activities after work, such as binge-watching dramas or scrolling through some micro-films on Bilibili (occasionally stumbling upon relationship-related content and starting to get emotional).</p>
<p>Sometimes, hours mysteriously pass by, and because I need to go to work the next day, I have no choice but to take some melatonin and sleep. There are even days when I come back home close to 10 pm, thinking I&rsquo;ll lie down for a bit, only to open my eyes again and find it&rsquo;s already past 1 am. I get up and open my computer, but end up not doing much.</p>
<p>As a result, productivity during after-work hours is hard to guarantee. Sometimes, I even force myself to do things. I resonate with a group member&rsquo;s description:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m now learning with a focus on weekly reports. Every time I want to completely lie down, I think about what to do if I haven&rsquo;t written the weekly review, and then I sit up in shock as if rising from my deathbed.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reflecting on the reasons for this state, I feel that I still find it difficult to get the improvement I want from work. Instead, it often consumes my spirit, and the time after work is not enough to recover, causing my productivity to be completely destroyed. Although there are indeed no task quantity regulations or external deadlines, I still often have some self-reproach. This is far from the ideal living state I pursue.</p>
<p>I seem to have heard this concept from a podcast: we all need to find the B-side hidden behind the A-side. If we take work projects as an A-side, the B-side is finding some points hidden within it. Whether it&rsquo;s innovation or some new technical attempts, they can give us more subjective willingness to complete them. If we take work itself as an A-side, then we need to think about how to fill the other side of this work that occupies most of our time. It can be learning and improvement, or it can be cultivating a simple hobby.</p>
<p>Of course, changing this state doesn&rsquo;t have a standard solution, and it has never been something that can be easily solved. But it needs to be slowly sorted out anyway. Currently, I&rsquo;m thinking that my next job will consider more remote work models to better balance my rhythm. I&rsquo;ve also been looking into some related information recently.</p>
<h2 id="new-friends">New Friends</h2>
<p>The surprise this week was meeting several friends I&rsquo;ve been following on Twitter for a long time. It started with a discussion about Cloudflare Pages with <a href="https://twitter.com/strrlthedev">STRRL</a> and adding each other as friends. Later, I joined a small group and met big names like <a href="https://twitter.com/RealAkemiHomura">Homura</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Manjusaka_Lee">Manjusaka</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/_a_wing">Xinyi</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/OnlyXuanwo">Xuanwo</a>. We occasionally have some daily exchanges about life and technology.</p>
<p>It seems that after graduation, I rarely actively socialize. I&rsquo;m unwilling to participate in gatherings with strangers in real life, and I&rsquo;ve closed my WeChat Moments entrance for four or five years. I don&rsquo;t know the current situation of my former classmates, making it even more difficult to have any opportunity for communication. I&rsquo;ve been in a closed state for a long time. On the contrary, I&rsquo;ve been rambling a lot on Twitter since May, and I&rsquo;m often amazed by the interesting lives and depth of thought of many Twitter friends. But I&rsquo;ve always been quietly watching, with very little direct interaction. This time, meeting so many new friends, I&rsquo;m very happy and surprised. I hope to have more exchanges in the future. Everyone is very nice.</p>
<h2 id="learning-and-input">Learning and Input</h2>
<p>This section will record some interesting things I&rsquo;ve come across and the progress of my work and study.</p>
<h3 id="technical-learning">Technical Learning</h3>
<p>This week, I first joined a new project and did some environment setup, which involved quite a few Docker-related operations. However, because I&rsquo;ve done similar things before, the overall process was quite smooth. Then, because it involves the Cosmos blockchain, I started reading &ldquo;Blockchain Architecture and Implementation: Detailed Explanation of Cosmos&rdquo; and made some notes. I&rsquo;m reading it slowly.</p>
<p>But after a few days, I was assigned to the early preparation of another project. There was a lot of tedious work, and I worked overtime for several consecutive days, but the development progress was not much. I hope the project goes smoothly.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t do much other technical learning this week. CSAPP, contract development, and the newly arrived Go language-related books all need to be pushed forward according to the schedule.</p>
<h3 id="input">Input</h3>
<h4 id="books">Books</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tim Cook: The Genius Who Took Apple to the Next Level</strong>, Although I heard it&rsquo;s mostly a compilation of reports and information, I&rsquo;m very interested in Apple as a company but have always been unfamiliar with Tim. Perhaps Steve Jobs&rsquo; halo is too strong, so I want to learn more about him.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="tv-series">TV Series</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Most Hated Man on the Internet</strong>, a new Netflix documentary. The mother in the event is strong, confident, and interesting. Compared to the previous documentary about the Nth Room case, it&rsquo;s less heavy and has more of a suspense rhythm. But after watching it late at night, I still feel helpless (or powerless). I just hope this world can have a little more kindness and humanity, even if it&rsquo;s just a little bit better.</li>
<li><strong>Extraordinary Attorney Woo</strong>, the female lead is still very cute, and the main couple is quite shippable.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="movies">Movies</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Moon Man</strong>, a standard comedy film for theaters. The music and atmosphere rendering are quite in place. As for the plot, it feels like a low-budget version of The Martian, and the ending is a bit too focused on core values.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="anime">Anime</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Summer Time Rendering</strong>, an anime series I look forward to updating every week.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tinkering-notes">Tinkering Notes</h2>
<h3 id="software-tinkering">Software Tinkering</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Arc</strong>, a newly popular browser. I tried it out, and the experience is very different. Currently, I haven&rsquo;t found any major flaws, but it will still mostly serve as an auxiliary browser. After all, I&rsquo;m too used to Safari.</li>
<li><strong>Arctype</strong>, a database management tool I saw in some recommendation article. The interface is very beautiful, and it can be divided into multiple workspaces. It also has a built-in visualization panel function. I haven&rsquo;t played with it in detail yet. Currently, my main tool is still TablePlus.</li>
</ol>
<p>After reading <a href="https://twitter.com/strrlthedev">STRRL</a>&rsquo;s weekly review last week, I also completely migrated my blog to Cloudflare Pages. The migration experience was very seamless, and the subsequent use feels great. At this point, my serverless blog system consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>GitHub as the source file for the Hugo blog and running some GitHub Actions to automatically update the About page</li>
<li>Cloudflare Pages hosting the blog, and using the domain hosted on Cloudflare for resolution</li>
<li>Hosting the Cusdis comment system and Umami data statistics system on Railway and Vercel</li>

<p>This piece is a record and reflection of my life from <code>July 11, 2022</code> to <code>July 24, 2022</code>. As for the reason for the delay - <strong>I was on vacation!!!</strong></p>
<h2 id="vacation">Vacation</h2>
<p>Including my internship, I&rsquo;ve been working for over a year now, but because projects have been ongoing, I&rsquo;ve had hardly any complete holidays except for the Spring Festival, and I&rsquo;ve accumulated quite a few compensatory days off. Coinciding with the successful completion of the second project, I applied to my leader for leave - 7 working days + 2 weekends, giving me a long-lost feeling of summer vacation.</p>
<h3 id="my-family-and-i">My Family and I</h3>
<p>Although the pandemic occasionally flares up, I ultimately decided to return to Hangzhou, to return home. Since leaving home in mid-2020, every visit back has felt hurried. The last time was during the National Day holiday, and I only stayed for about 3 days. Excluding gatherings with relatives, the time actually spent with family probably doesn&rsquo;t even add up to a full day, just enough to briefly discuss my recent situation and thoughts before embarking on the return journey. This time, perhaps because quite a lot has happened to me in the past six months, I felt somewhat tired and just wanted to rest and adjust at home, while also wanting to spend more time with my family (mainly taking my sister out to play).</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t really noticed my own growth that significantly, but at family dinner tables, I seem to have become the main force in leading toasts to various elders. When the younger generation gathers to play, it&rsquo;s now me making the arrangements. Even my sister, who always seemed so little in my memory, will be entering junior high school after this summer vacation. It&rsquo;s as if from some point on, time began to flow by more rapidly. In the midst of busy studies and work, there wasn&rsquo;t much awareness of this, and it&rsquo;s only when I return home to experience slowed-down time or occasionally recall bits and pieces deeply hidden in memory that I feel a twinge of sentiment.</p>
<h3 id="my-sister-and-i">My Sister and I</h3>
<p>I have a sister who is 13 years younger than me, which often makes my classmates and friends envious. This age difference isn&rsquo;t so great as to cause any arguments or conflicts, and as I&rsquo;ve grown up, I&rsquo;ve been able to take care of her more. During high school, because of living at school and preparing for the college entrance exam, I couldn&rsquo;t really be there for her much, and after college, I was even more scattered about, only having somewhat complete time together during winter and summer breaks. After starting work, we&rsquo;ve spent even less time together, with only daily casual chats in WeChat groups and occasional phone calls. I don&rsquo;t know how she evaluates my role as a brother; I hope I&rsquo;m doing an adequate job.</p>
<p>So this time when I came home, I took my sister to take some photos, stroll along the pedestrian street, do some handicrafts, visit the aquarium, and go to the One Way Street Bookstore to read together. Many of these things seem quite ordinary, but perhaps because I was too much of a homebody before and missed out, they were all quite novel experiences. Every time we finished an outing or playtime and walked home hand in hand, I could feel a kind of serene beauty in it.</p>
<p>This time I also brought my camera back, and tinkered with the newly bought DJI RS3 stabilizer (it&rsquo;s really good to use!!!), taking many photos and videos, which also serves to leave some memory fragments for her childhood that&rsquo;s drawing to a close.</p>
<h3 id="my-teacher-and-i">My Teacher and I</h3>
<p>Although it&rsquo;s been nearly ten years since graduating from junior high school, every winter and summer vacation or during breaks like this, I would meet up with my junior high homeroom teacher, Brother Chun, for meals and chats. However, in the past, Ni and Zhan would always be there too, but now they&rsquo;re all scattered overseas, and it might be quite difficult to gather together in the future. Perhaps because we meet quite frequently, even after so many years, it doesn&rsquo;t feel like there have been many changes between us. We talk like friends about everything from studies and work to relationships and thoughts, often losing track of time for four or five hours, and often marveling that we&rsquo;ve known each other for 13 years now.</p>
<h2 id="sense-of-belonging-in-cities">Sense of Belonging in Cities</h2>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/dayuecheng.jpg" alt="dayuecheng"></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to note that after graduating from high school, I went to Wuhan for university, and subsequently did internships of considerable duration in cities like Shanghai and Xiamen. Not long after, I went to Hong Kong for graduate studies, and soon after finishing, I went to Beijing for an internship and work. I&rsquo;ve lived in quite a few cities, but in terms of both environment and emotional connection to the people in these cities, it&rsquo;s hard for me to claim that I belong to any particular place.</p>
<p>Hangzhou, where I&rsquo;ve lived the longest, lacks my presence during the university years, and I have very few connections left with junior and senior high school classmates. Most of my closest friends have also left Hangzhou, mostly overseas. When I came back this time, I found that I couldn&rsquo;t even think of anyone to go out for a meal or drinks with, so I had to give up on that idea. After graduation, I returned to Wuhan a few times due to my student entrepreneurship at the time. After graduation, I only kept in touch with a few mentors, roommates, and the original group of four that I often played with, but they&rsquo;re all scattered in various places now, only able to meet once or twice when on business trips. Subsequently, due to the outbreak of the pandemic, I haven&rsquo;t been back for more than two years. The year in Hong Kong was full of a sense of urgency, and apart from romantic relationships, I didn&rsquo;t seem to have met many people, and the time spent together was brief, gradually losing touch after graduation. Ironically, in Beijing, because I originally had a few good friends, and also formed some good friendships with colleagues and work partners due to work projects.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been quite a homebody, and I don&rsquo;t really have a strong perception of a city&rsquo;s climate or features. I also have pretty good adaptability to environments, so I&rsquo;ve never considered the city as an important factor in my various decisions. However, after this trip back, many of my thoughts have changed.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/xinfeng_food.jpg" alt="xinfeng_food"></p>
<p>When I was alone in Beijing, although it wasn&rsquo;t particularly miserable, I always felt that every blade of grass and every tree lacked some kind of attachment, as if all these had nothing to do with me. But when I returned to Hangzhou, even just walking by the river, I could feel some familiarity. I would also visit the shops I used to frequent, or take a 30-minute bus ride to eat at Xinfeng Restaurant that I had been craving for a long time, or sit for several hours in the One Way Street Bookstore, reliving the leisurely times of spending entire afternoons in bookstores in the past.</p>
<p>This might be the warmth and sense of belonging that a city brings to people. As we grow older, we tend to care more about these things.</p>
<h2 id="learning-input-and-output">Learning, Input, and Output</h2>
<p>This section will record some interesting things I&rsquo;ve encountered and the progress of my work and studies.</p>
<h3 id="technical-learning">Technical Learning</h3>
<p>The first week was mainly spent on wrapping up some project work and preparing for new projects. There wasn&rsquo;t much development work to do, but I bought some technical books, planning to delve into them properly after the vacation.</p>
<p>The technical books are mainly &ldquo;<strong>Writing a Compiler in Go</strong>&rdquo;, &ldquo;<strong>Writing an Interpreter in Go</strong>&rdquo;, &ldquo;<strong>The Road to Go Language Proficiency</strong>&rdquo;, and a book I&rsquo;ve been planning to read for a long time but never got around to, &ldquo;<strong>Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code</strong>&rdquo;. I feel that reading these books after having some project experience will be more profound.</p>
<p>For non-technical books, I bought a set related to thinking, &ldquo;<strong>The Pyramid Principle</strong>&rdquo;, for cultivating some thinking methods. I&rsquo;ll make some notes on all of these later.</p>
<p>Two days before the vacation, I participated in the technical sharing I mentioned before, mainly talking about some of my experiences and insights in learning blockchain. The overall feeling was good, and I&rsquo;ll rearrange the lecture notes into a blog post later. I originally wanted to organize it right after the talk, but the vacation was about to start. Although I brought my laptop, I basically didn&rsquo;t work or study, just purely relaxed.</p>
<h3 id="input">Input</h3>
<h4 id="books">Books</h4>
<p>In terms of books, I&rsquo;m continuing to read &ldquo;The Stolen Bicycle&rdquo;. I should be able to finish it this week. Then I also plan to read several books that are more information-oriented:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Working in Public</strong>, which talks about open-source software</li>
<li><strong>Tim Cook: The Genius Who Took Apple to the Next Level</strong>, although I&rsquo;ve heard it&rsquo;s mostly a compilation of reports and information, I&rsquo;m very interested in Apple as a company but have always been unfamiliar with Tim, perhaps because Steve Jobs&rsquo; halo is too strong, so I want to learn more about him</li>
</ul>
<p>Apart from these, I saw a book at One Way Street Bookstore that I had read several years ago, &ldquo;Stoner&rdquo;. I flipped through it and suddenly felt like revisiting it, feeling that I might gain new insights in terms of self-discovery.</p>
<h4 id="tv-series">TV Series</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Normal People</strong>, I had watched more than half of it before, but for some reason put it aside. Normal People tells the story of a male and female protagonist from the same town and some stories about their surroundings. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s because the male lead is an English major or has the same fragile and sensitive qualities, but I feel like I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of myself in him</li>
<li><strong>Extraordinary Attorney Woo</strong>, a Korean drama with a legal theme. I mainly watched it because I found the female lead&rsquo;s character setting quite cute from a brief introduction</li>
<li><strong>The Bear</strong>, a story about a chef returning to run a family restaurant. It&rsquo;s not long, with a very good pace. I watched it on the high-speed train on the way back</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="movies">Movies</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Newness</strong>, which offers some reflections on emotions and social interactions in today&rsquo;s society, mainly talking about hook-up culture. However, I felt the expression and twists were strange, not recommended</li>
<li><strong>The Gray Man</strong>, an action movie that&rsquo;s quite popular recently. It&rsquo;s said to be Netflix&rsquo;s highest-budget film. Watching it gave me a bit of a John Wick feel</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="anime">Anime</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Demon Slayer</strong>, I really liked the first season, but hadn&rsquo;t followed up for a while. This time I caught up with the Mugen Train Arc and the Entertainment District Arc, really enjoyed them</li>
<li><strong>Weathering with You</strong>, I&rsquo;ve wanted to watch it for a long time. I&rsquo;ve seen many edited and remade versions, but never the original. Finally watched it, very Makoto Shinkai style</li>
<li><strong>Summer Time Rendering</strong>, still following it, the plot is getting more and more intense and unpredictable, very pleasantly surprised</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="others">Others</h2>
<p>In the end, I chose a gray-green color for my hair. It took two bleaching sessions and one dyeing session. I think it looks quite good, although it&rsquo;s a bit flamboyant, but very anime-like. Perhaps my delayed rebellious phase has finally arrived, and I can try more styles in the future.</p>

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>It seems that every time I start with the title, I try to set a theme for the past week. Sometimes it&rsquo;s not that easy to summarize, but I still persist in doing so. Perhaps this way, life will be like a series of chapters pieced together, and when looking back after a long time, it will feel like a fulfilling book.</p>
<p>This piece is a record and reflection of my life from <code>2022-07-04</code> to <code>2022-07-10</code>.</p>
<h2 id="health">Health</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s due to work fatigue or some lingering mental effects, but recently I&rsquo;ve felt that my health has been declining. It&rsquo;s not particularly serious, but I often feel a sense of weakness, sometimes even feeling as if my body isn&rsquo;t my own.</p>
<p>It seems that for so many years, I haven&rsquo;t really paid much attention to my health. Although I&rsquo;ve had medical check-ups, not exactly regularly but still done, there haven&rsquo;t been any major issues. Therefore, I didn&rsquo;t pay much attention. Sometimes I even felt a little proud that after so many years of staying up late, my eyesight and body hadn&rsquo;t been affected much. However, the recent symptoms have made me start to be more vigilant about changes in my body.</p>
<p>The first thing that needs attention is diet. Because I&rsquo;ve been practicing intermittent fasting (16+8), which means keeping 16 hours without food and concentrating the main two meals within the remaining 8 hours, I haven&rsquo;t eaten breakfast for a long time. Due to the regular schedule of going to the office on workdays, I can basically ensure lunch around 12 o&rsquo;clock, occasionally having a light meal with colleagues after work or eating something at home. However, on weekends it&rsquo;s much harder to control, sometimes having only one meal a day or just fruits. This part also needs adjustment, and I need to pay attention to nutritional balance.</p>
<p>Sleep has always been a known issue that&rsquo;s difficult to adjust. For the past two months, it&rsquo;s as if I&rsquo;ve been deprived of sleep, falling asleep around 4 or 5 am every day, waking up after 8, then commuting and starting a day&rsquo;s work. Actually, my mental state hasn&rsquo;t been affected much, surprisingly, not even needing a nap. But there has been some invisible consumption. This week, I&rsquo;ve intentionally adjusted to sleeping from around 2 am to 8 am, which feels a bit better.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to have a full-body check-up in July. To be honest, I&rsquo;m quite worried about the results. It&rsquo;s like those two years of intense entrepreneurship during university when I didn&rsquo;t dare to go to the hospital for a check-up. It seems that without a definite index, I could continue to overdraw my health with peace of mind. Fortunately, everything was fine then, and I hope it will be the same this time.</p>
<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
<p>More than two years ago, when I was restructuring my blog, I wrote these paragraphs on the &ldquo;<a href="https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/about/">About</a>&rdquo; page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>In terms of life</strong>, I hope to continue to support each other with my current close friends, maintain the current relationship with my family that is both intimate and friendly, face life&rsquo;s challenges together with the people I care about, and also meet more interesting people.
<strong>Professionally</strong>, I hope to continue to make progress and be able to leave some traces in the open-source world.
<strong>Economically</strong>, I hope to be self-sufficient, able to support doing what I want to do, and explore a more diverse future life.
<strong>Socially</strong>, I hope to have the opportunity to participate in more charitable activities or other forms of good deeds, to bring some small changes to the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, perhaps because what I set at that time was not very specific, or because I haven&rsquo;t made much progress in this aspect, looking back at this point now, I don&rsquo;t have much to add. I just think more concretely about what kind of person I want to become.</p>
<p>Overall, I want to be an interesting person, to live a life that&rsquo;s a bit different. And the difference I pursue, I hope, is not just relying on changes in work content or environment, but rather to find or try and explore what I want to do and perhaps happen to be good at doing. Even if I don&rsquo;t have the ability to do it full-time or wholeheartedly, I hope to find it and persist.</p>
<p>Of course, I want to be more specific. This part will also be recorded in the weekly review from now on, as a record of continuous exploration. At least I should look at some of the lifestyles I aspire to, and break down what I need to change and pay for to achieve what I want to do.</p>
<h2 id="the-rhythm-of-life">The Rhythm of Life</h2>
<p>This week, I went out to eat with two friends separately. This is probably the most face-to-face communication I&rsquo;ve had in the past few months apart from colleagues, and they are also among the very few friends I can talk to in Beijing.</p>
<p>One of them is a senior from my undergraduate school, one year ahead of me. We&rsquo;ve always maintained a relatively close contact, regularly chatting about recent situations. When I traveled to Guangzhou before, I also received a lot of care from her. But meeting or chatting is far from frequent. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s because of the identity of &ldquo;President -&gt; Department Head&rdquo; or &ldquo;Senior -&gt; Junior&rdquo; from university times, it seems that we&rsquo;ve never had very deep inner communication. On the contrary, after we all started working, we have a deeper understanding of each other&rsquo;s life states, and can be more empathetic, giving mutual care and support.</p>
<p>The other is also a senior from my undergraduate school, but I met her through my tutor Liangliang after graduation. At that time, I was about to go to Hong Kong, and Liangliang said she had previously studied for her master&rsquo;s degree in Hong Kong and subsequently worked there, so we could exchange ideas and have someone to rely on. However, just a month after I arrived in Hong Kong, she left due to personal planning. Here were some of my thoughts at that time:</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/some_thoughts_about_boyi.png" alt="some_thoughts_about_boyi"></p>
<p>Unconsciously, it&rsquo;s been almost two years. I didn&rsquo;t expect that I would come to work in Beijing later, which is quite a coincidence. Her lifestyle and attitude have always been what I aspire to. Whether it was in Hong Kong before or now in Beijing, even though the work environment and rhythm are completely different, she can still learn violin, paint, go surfing, boxing, rock climbing, dancing, etc. on weekends or in her spare time.</p>
<p>She said she hopes to do something at least meaningful to herself every weekend from now on. I feel that she has always been able to practice some of her ideas. I think it&rsquo;s not just a matter of execution, in this aspect I might not be bad, but I can clearly feel that she is able to clearly define the boundaries between her work, life and personal ideas. I call it the rhythm of life, and I hope I can do better in the future.</p>
<p>An interesting episode was chatting with the owner and a group of friends at the Japanese restaurant. Maybe it was the Beijing accent and the bizarre experiences, the whole conversation was like a stand-up comedy. It was also the first time I felt that I was quite good at catching jokes. It was also a rare purely relaxing experience in the past few months.</p>
<h2 id="learning-input-and-output">Learning, Input and Output</h2>
<p>This part will record some of the various audio-visual books I&rsquo;ve seen, interesting things I&rsquo;ve tinkered with, and some progress in work and study.</p>
<h3 id="technical-learning">Technical Learning</h3>
<p>I have to admit that both my work output and my own learning progress during leisure time have fallen behind this week. This is mainly because the project has come to an end, most of the work tasks are to cooperate in completing some tests and document changes, as well as discussing some technical solutions, without any substantial development work; the rest is explaining our products and implementation solutions to new project clients of the company.</p>
<p>Even so, there are still many trivial matters. I often get home after 9 o&rsquo;clock, and haven&rsquo;t taken out a complete time to watch courses or read books. I need to make some adjustments next week, mainly focusing on contract development and CSAPP.</p>
<p>I was invited as a guest to participate in a technical sharing on July 14th, facing a quite famous community, about half an hour, with the theme &ldquo;How web2 engineers can enter web3&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s also my first time participating in such a large-scale technical sharing, and I&rsquo;ve just entered the industry not long ago, so I&rsquo;m a bit nervous and need to prepare well.</p>
<h3 id="input">Input</h3>
<h4 id="books">Books</h4>
<p>In terms of books, this week I finished &ldquo;Lolita&rdquo; which I had been reading during my commute, and started reading &ldquo;The Stolen Bicycle&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m gradually getting used to reading books on crowded subways, accumulating slowly this way can allow me to read a lot.</p>
<p>I saw this <a href="https://twitter.com/yihong0618/status/1507000968478871559?s=21&amp;t=TfLr28X_8uLPyPPJCrzYeA">thread</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/yihong0618">@yihong0618</a>, and I also want to revisit many of Murakami&rsquo;s books. I remember reading &ldquo;1Q84&rdquo; with my classmates in high school, and was deeply impressed by its form of expression; during university, reading books like &ldquo;What I Talk About When I Talk About Running&rdquo; also gave me a lot of thoughts about life. Perhaps rereading some at this stage will bring a different experience.</p>
<h4 id="tv-series">TV Series</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Boys</strong>, a novel anti-superhero theme, the quality of the three seasons has been consistently high, very worth recommending</li>
<li><strong>Mr. Robot</strong>, I watched the first few seasons a few years ago, but I rewatched it and followed the latest season. It&rsquo;s very exciting, and many places are also thought-provoking</li>
<li><strong>High Score</strong>, a documentary about the history of electronic games that I watched during meal breaks every day. It&rsquo;s not outstanding but it&rsquo;s a good popular science</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="movies">Movies</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Blade Runner 2049</strong>, some apocalyptic themes plus elements of love. Perhaps now that technology has developed to the present, looking at these themes again, there&rsquo;s less sense of surprise but more worry and even despair about the future</li>
<li><strong>Her</strong>, also with elements of technology and love, telling a story of falling in love with artificial intelligence. To be honest, there&rsquo;s quite a bit I can relate to. Perhaps I&rsquo;m also too reliant on and addicted to technology, even ignoring the sense of reality in many people&rsquo;s emotional lives</li>
<li><strong>Nomadland</strong>, describing the living conditions of a group of homeless people in America. It can serve as another perspective, but the sense of deliberate rendering is too heavy to truly move</li>
<li><strong>Roman Holiday</strong>, a classic is a classic, Audrey Hepburn is truly beautiful</li>
<li><strong>Groundhog Day</strong>, I had seen a Groundhog Day-style short film made by a Japanese YouTuber before, and had always wanted to watch this. Finally caught up</li>
<li><strong>Persian Lessons</strong>, I remember missing it when it was re-released before, so I&rsquo;m catching up. But it wasn&rsquo;t very surprising. Among similar war themes, I might still prefer &ldquo;Life Is Beautiful&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>The Wind Rises</strong>, also a war theme. I was recommended it in high school but never watched it. Finally caught up, and I quite like it</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="anime">Anime</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Kaguya-sama: Love Is War Season 3</strong>, a romantic comedy, I really like it. Every season has been quite amazing, and the ending was really sweet</li>
<li><strong>SPY×FAMILY</strong>, also leaning towards comedy. The first few episodes were quite surprising, but later it became a bit too exaggerated. Some character settings are also not very consistent, but overall it&rsquo;s very joyful</li>
<li><strong>Summer Time Rendering</strong>, the most surprising new anime. The worldview and sense of rhythm are both amazing. It&rsquo;s also a half-year series, will continue to follow</li>
<li><strong>My Stepmom&rsquo;s Daughter Is My Ex</strong>, it feels like my second dimension attribute suddenly awakened, and I started to follow some anime again. The name is weird but after watching one episode, it&rsquo;s not bad</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="output">Output</h3>
<p>This week I still wrote two articles that I&rsquo;m quite satisfied with:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2022/07/05/access_your_local_devices_using_reverse_proxy_tool_frp/">Thin Client Development Workflow Based on frp Intranet Penetration</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2022/07/05/access_your_local_devices_using_reverse_proxy_tool_frp/">Warp, iTerm2 or Alacritty? My Terminal Tinkering Notes</a></li>
</ol>
<p>The surprise is that the first one was selected for the member&rsquo;s selection of Sspai, which is also unlocking a new achievement; the latter has just been completed and sent to the editor, waiting for feedback; but the blockchain-related article that was commissioned much earlier, I haven&rsquo;t started yet, maybe it should also be put on the agenda.</p>
<p>Gradually, I&rsquo;ve developed my own style of writing such articles, writing logic, and have some of my own writing rhythm and fixed frequency. I will continue to accumulate some topics I want to write about in the future.</p>
<h2 id="habits-interests-and-changes">Habits, Interests and Changes</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s no progress in cultivating habits and interests this week. Later, at least Ring Fit Adventure should have a fixed frequency to start, and some things I want to learn should also begin. I need to overcome the sense of weariness towards life.</p>
<p>Then I want to dye my hair, currently considering granny gray or flaxen green, haven&rsquo;t chosen yet.</p>
<h2 id="others">Others</h2>
<p>The most noteworthy thing is that my 6th-grade sister has started writing a web novel series, which is about immortal cultivation. She stays up an hour late every night to type for an hour on her iPad, has persisted for about a week with daily updates, published on a web novel platform, and has received quite a lot of reads and exposure. Many people are urging for updates, and we often compete with each other now, frequently asking each other if we&rsquo;re writing articles.</p>
<p>Next week I plan to start taking compensatory leave to accompany my parents and family. The last time I went back was during the National Day holiday last year. I also want to find an opportunity to travel, but the pandemic has really brought many variables.</p>

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>As a developer, whether running and debugging code locally or deploying and maintaining projects on remote servers, we can&rsquo;t do without the terminal shown in the image below, which is the black window often seen in sci-fi movies.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/my_terminal_tools.png" alt="my_terminal_tools"></p>
<p>Operating systems generally have their default shells, such as &ldquo;Powershell&rdquo; on Windows, and bash or zsh on macOS and Linux systems. Systems with graphical interfaces also come with pre-installed terminal emulators, like &ldquo;Terminal.app&rdquo; on macOS and various terminal programs bundled with Linux distributions.</p>
<p>As a productivity tool enthusiast and aesthete, my tinkering with terminal configuration and customization has never ceased, going through several iterations. Perhaps unlike most developers, I&rsquo;m not a devotee of any particular solution. Instead, I try various tools, configuring them according to my habits to reduce operational differences between different solutions. In daily development, I switch seamlessly between them based on purpose, sometimes even randomly choosing one to use as a mood changer.</p>
<p>This article mainly describes my terminal solution choices and configuration details.</p>
<h2 id="terminal-configuration-requirements">Terminal Configuration Requirements</h2>
<p>Terminal configuration consists of several aspects:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Tool Configuration</strong>. When developing on macOS or Windows systems, we often need a terminal emulator to connect to the local development environment or remote servers. This is usually a resident application in our development process, and its aesthetics, response speed, and shortcuts greatly affect our development experience, making it the focus of our configuration and customization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Functional Configuration</strong>. When using the command line to perform operations on system services/files, we need to use shells like bash or zsh. Configuring command prompts, auto-completion, and other features can effectively enhance our user experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Integration Configuration</strong>. Besides running common command-line tools like git, terminals often need to meet advanced needs such as text editing and multi-task management. Therefore, deeply integrating tools like vim and tmux through terminal configuration is also an important aspect of optimizing our development experience.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;ve outlined my terminal usage requirements, listing the following core points:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Minimalist Style</strong>. As software that I need to face for long periods every day, even the fanciest themes can become tiresome and even affect my focus. Therefore, my basic approach to configuring the appearance and operational logic of terminal tools is Minimal Distraction - simple but not monotonous.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fast Response</strong>. Initially, I focused on aesthetics and functionality in terminal configuration, installing many plugins and configurations, but this also resulted in the unpleasant experience of several seconds of delay each time the software started. Therefore, the response speed during use is also a focus of my solution selection and optimization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Customizability</strong>. Because I use the special Vim &ldquo;HJKL&rdquo; key layout for my code editor and window management, I also hope to be able to configure flexible shortcuts to reduce the cost of switching between different software.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Portability</strong>. I often need to operate on different devices, and occasionally there are device iterations. I hope my configurations can be conveniently ported to new devices/servers, preferably reusing the same configuration file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Extensibility</strong>. I hope to be able to extend some functions and plugins according to my needs, such as using fzf to search for files or command history, jumping to specified directories via commands, using waka-time to record my programming time, etc.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="my-terminal-configuration-explanation">My Terminal Configuration Explanation</h2>
<p>Even with relatively clear requirements, finding suitable tools and configuration solutions is still a challenging but enjoyable task. Next, I will describe the solutions I&rsquo;m still using and quite satisfied with, and provide my configuration files for reference.</p>
<p>Furthermore, since I develop on macOS most of the time, my terminal tool configurations are mainly based on the macOS platform. However, some tools or plugins (such as Alacritty, ohmyzsh, Neovim, etc.) are cross-platform, with similar configuration methods that can be referenced and configured according to actual situations.</p>
<h3 id="warp">Warp</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/warp_interface.png" alt="warp_interface"></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m naturally inclined to tinker, hoping to have enough customization space for various configurations. However, if I were to recommend only one tool to newcomers who have just started using terminals, I would unhesitatingly choose &ldquo;<a href="https://www.warp.dev">Warp</a>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Warp is a modern terminal tool developed based on Rust, which is extremely fast, powerful, and ready to use out of the box. It supports intelligent prompts, AI command smart search, command history query, custom workflows, and other functions without additional configuration.</p>
<p>I was one of the early batch of users participating in Warp&rsquo;s internal testing. Even in the early stages when the functions were still incomplete, I was amazed by its exquisite appearance and smooth user experience. Because it&rsquo;s developed using the Rust language, Warp&rsquo;s command execution and response speed are very fast. Moreover, it has many common functions built-in, allowing us to get powerful functional support without configuring plugins like history search and command prompts at the Shell layer.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/warp_code_block.png" alt="warp_code_block"></p>
<p>It also has many unique features that traditional terminals don&rsquo;t possess, such as the concept of &ldquo;blocks&rdquo;. Each command execution is presented in the form of a &ldquo;command block&rdquo;, allowing movement between blocks using arrow keys, avoiding the need to constantly drag the scroll bar to read when some command output results are too long. We can also bookmark, copy commands, search content, or even share online specific blocks through the upper right corner.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/edit_command_in_warp.png" alt="edit_command_in_warp"></p>
<p>Different from the experience of conventional terminal tools, Warp&rsquo;s command input window is permanently fixed at the bottom (closer to an IDE), visually separating our command input from result feedback. Moreover, its input mode is closer to a text editor - we can move the cursor freely using the mouse or keyboard to edit, modify commands, or input multi-line commands for sequential execution. This is what I consider to be Warp&rsquo;s killer feature.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/warp_other_feature.png" alt="warp_other_feature"></p>
<p>We only need to use the corresponding shortcuts in the input box to invoke functions like history search and custom workflows, and can use the mouse wheel or direction keys for selection, which is very flexible. More powerful is that when we use Warp to connect to a remote terminal via SSH, these shortcuts are still effective, such as history search, without the need for configuration on the target server.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also worth mentioning that we can use the built-in shortcuts <code>Command+D</code> and <code>Command+Shift+D</code> to split the terminal horizontally or vertically, without the need to integrate other tools or perform additional configuration.</p>
<p>With the development of technology, text editors have been continuously updated, adding rich features and providing better user experiences. However, the terminal that we developers work with day and night has been developing slowly. Warp was born in this context, just as its official website describes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The terminal for the 21st century.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="iterm2">iTerm2</h3>
<p>Before using Warp, my main terminal tool was <a href="https://iterm2.com">iTerm2</a>, which I believe is also a must-install software for many developers when they first get a Mac (after all, the aesthetics and playability of the default terminal are not great). iTerm2 is a long-standing terminal tool that combines aesthetics and functionality, and even its default configuration already meets our needs very well.</p>
<h4 id="appearance-and-color-scheme">Appearance and Color Scheme</h4>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/iterm2_interface.png" alt="iterm2_interface"></p>
<p>I modified the configuration of a YouTuber &ldquo;<a href="https://www.craftz.dog">Takuya Matsuyama</a>&rdquo; to customize a minimalist appearance scheme.</p>
<p>First, configure the theme, tab bar, and status bar in the <strong>Preferences</strong> - <strong>Appearance</strong> section as follows to maintain a relatively simple layout.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/iterm2_theme_config.png" alt="iterm2_theme_config"></p>
<p>After completing the theme configuration, right-click the bottom status bar for detailed configuration. I selected some status bar components to display device status in real-time. This part can be chosen according to your preferences.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/iterm2_status_components.png" alt="iterm2_status_components"></p>
<p>Select your theme color scheme or import other color schemes in the <strong>Profile</strong> - <strong>Colors</strong> panel. You can click <a href="https://github.com/pseudoyu/dotfiles/tree/master/iterm2">here</a> to download my configuration file, import it, and adjust it according to your needs.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/iterm2_window_blur_setting.png" alt="iterm2_window_blur_setting"></p>
<p>After selecting the color scheme, I achieved a transparent background and frosted glass effect (window blur) by adjusting Transparency and Blur. This can be adjusted according to the visual effect of the specific device.</p>
<p>After configuring the terminal tool, we still need to configure the Shell to integrate some custom themes, intelligent prompts, search history records, and other extension modules. I use the zsh + ohmyzsh + starship solution. Since these configurations are common to various solutions, see the Alacritty configuration description section below for details.</p>
<h4 id="multi-server-management">Multi-server Management</h4>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/iterm2_profile_settings.png" alt="iterm2_profile_settings"></p>
<p>Currently, I mainly use iTerm2 to connect to my various remote hosts/servers. It provides convenient multi-configuration management functionality, allowing quick switching between different servers or configuration environments by setting different Profiles, and can use conspicuous Badges as identifiers.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/iterm2_multiple_servers_management.png" alt="iterm2_multiple_servers_management"></p>
<p>When we need to connect to multiple development machines for work or personal use, we can open the server by pressing <code>Command+O</code> or by right-clicking the iTerm2 icon in the Dock bar to select the corresponding Profile. We can also use the built-in shortcuts <code>Command+D</code> and <code>Command+Shift+D</code> to split the terminal horizontally or vertically, facilitating simultaneous operation of multiple servers without constantly switching windows.</p>
<h3 id="alacritty">Alacritty</h3>
<p>iTerm2 is already a terminal tool with a very balanced aesthetic and functionality on the macOS platform, but its overall response speed and configuration freedom are not so perfect. Therefore, I now mainly use it to connect to remote servers, and have switched to <a href="https://alacritty.org">Alacritty</a> for my commonly used local terminal.</p>
<p>Alacritty is also a cross-platform terminal tool written in Rust, providing some basic default configurations and customizing various settings through the <code>~/.config/alacritty/alacritty.yml</code> file. You can click <a href="https://github.com/pseudoyu/dotfiles/tree/master/alacritty">here</a> to access my complete configuration.</p>
<h4 id="appearance-configuration">Appearance Configuration</h4>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/alacritty_interface.png" alt="alacritty_interface"></p>
<p>For the appearance part, I mainly use the following configuration for window and font settings, achieving a semi-transparent minimalist configuration without any borders or buttons. Other configurations can be viewed on your own, such as select-to-copy and other commonly used features in iTerm2, which can be implemented through a few simple configuration items.</p>

<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/alacritty_starship_config.png" alt="alacritty_starship_config"></p>
<p>I use zsh as the default terminal and use ohmyzsh to extend plugin functionality. zsh + ohmyzsh is currently a very popular Shell configuration solution, with a rich plugin system that can easily implement various extended functions through a few lines of configuration. First, we install according to its <a href="https://ohmyz.sh/#install">official instructions</a>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">sh -c <span class="s2">&#34;</span><span class="k">$(</span>curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh<span class="k">)</span><span class="s2">&#34;</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>I configured starship to beautify the Shell prompt. Similarly, we install and configure according to the <a href="https://starship.rs/guide/#%F0%9F%9A%80-installation">official instructions</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">curl -sS https://starship.rs/install.sh <span class="p">|</span> sh

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In addition, we can add plugin configurations in the plugin section of <code>~/.zshrc</code>. For example, I configured the following plugins to support intelligent prompts, syntax highlighting, <code>Ctrl + R</code> to search command history, and <code>j + &lt;path&gt;</code> for quick jumps.</p>

<h4 id="tmux">tmux</h4>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/acacritty_tmux_demo.png" alt="acacritty_tmux_demo"></p>
<p>Because Alacritty itself doesn&rsquo;t provide functions like window splitting and session management, we need to integrate <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki">tmux</a>, a powerful cross-platform window management tool.</p>
<p>macOS platform users can install it via <code>brew install tmux</code>, while other platforms can install according to the <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki/Installing">official instructions</a>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s configured through <code>~/.tmux.conf</code>. Click <a href="https://github.com/pseudoyu/dotfiles/tree/master/tmux">here</a> to view my configuration. Because its configuration and use require some learning and memory costs, this article will not describe it in detail. It&rsquo;s recommended to learn through the official documentation or other complete tutorials.</p>
<h4 id="neovim">Neovim</h4>
<p>We generally write code for our daily development in VS Code or Jetbrains&rsquo; IDEs, while debugging requires the use of a terminal. If you don&rsquo;t want to frequently switch between various software, we can choose vim, an editing tool that can be used on the command line.</p>
<p>However, native vim is just a simple window, which seems out of place with our well-configured terminal. Therefore, we will also beautify and configure vim. Due to space limitations, this article will not cover specific configuration and usage content related to vim, but only describe my configuration solution.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/vi_homepage.png" alt="vi_homepage"></p>
<p>I use neovim, a derivative version of vim, whose high version uses lua for configuration and plugin management. I use a scheme customized by my friend <a href="https://github.com/Cluas">Cluas</a>, and made some modifications and adjustments based on it. You can click <a href="https://github.com/pseudoyu/nvim/tree/pseudoyu">here</a> to view it. You only need to clone or download the <code>nvim/</code> directory and copy it to <code>~/.config</code>.</p>
<p>Its display effect is as follows:</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/neovim_file_preview.png" alt="neovim_file_preview"></p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/neovim_edit_file.png" alt="neovim_edit_file"></p>
<h4 id="shortcut-configuration">Shortcut Configuration</h4>
<p>tmux is a powerful window management tool, but it&rsquo;s very cumbersome to use <code>&lt;Ctrl+b&gt; + %</code> or <code>&lt;Ctrl+b&gt; + :</code> for horizontal or vertical screen splitting, or <code>&lt;Ctrl+b&gt; + c</code> to create a new window every time.</p>
<p>So, is there a way to achieve screen splitting or creating new windows through macOS&rsquo;s built-in shortcuts like <code>Command+D</code>, <code>Command+Shift+D</code>, or <code>Command+T</code> used by other terminal editors?</p>
<p>After some research and tinkering, I perfectly implemented this requirement by referring to <a href="https://www.joshmedeski.com">Josh Medeski</a>&rsquo;s article &ldquo;<a href="https://www.joshmedeski.com/posts/macos-keyboard-shortcuts-for-tmux">macOS Keyboard Shortcuts for tmux</a>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The basic implementation method is to enter the <code>xxd -psd</code> command in the terminal, then type the tmux shortcut you want to map, such as <code>&lt;Ctrl+b&gt; + c</code>. It will display the hex codes for this input as:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">^Bc
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">02630a
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Here, <code>02</code> represents <code>&lt;Ctrl+b&gt;</code>, <code>63</code> represents <code>c</code>, and <code>0a</code> represents the enter key. Therefore, the hex code corresponding to the shortcut for creating a new window in tmux is <code>\x02\x63</code>. We can configure the following option in the key_bindings section of <code>~/.config/alacritty/alacritty.yml</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nt">key_bindings</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w">
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="w">  </span>- {<span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">key: T, mods: Command, chars</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&#34;\x02\x63&#34;</span><span class="w"> </span>}<span class="w">
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>The implementation principle for other shortcut configurations is the same. You can click <a href="https://github.com/pseudoyu/dotfiles/tree/master/alacritty">here</a> to view all my shortcut configurations and modify them as needed.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Up to this point, I have introduced and explained the configuration of the three terminal tools I currently use. The out-of-the-box Warp has its strengths, iTerm2 achieves a nice balance between ease of use and customization, and Alacritty has its own joy of tinkering.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, sometimes switching to a different terminal is a whole new mood, and constantly optimizing and tinkering in leisure time is also a form of relaxation. Of course, everyone&rsquo;s terminal configuration has its own preferences and characteristics. This article only introduced my solution, which mostly satisfies my aesthetic pursuit and functional needs. I hope it can provide a reference for your terminal configuration. If you encounter problems in configuration or have better optimization suggestions, feel free to communicate.</p>

<p>In my previous project <a href="https://github.com/pseudoyu/yu-tools">&ldquo;GitHub - Personal Toolbox&rdquo;</a>, I mentioned that I have a Mac Studio that&rsquo;s always on at home and a Raspberry Pi 3b+ microcomputer running Ubuntu. When at home, I usually operate the Mac Studio connected to a monitor or access it via SSH from my Chromebook terminal.</p>
<p>After ending remote work, I need to commute between the office and home daily. Not wanting to carry a laptop every day, I left my previous 16-inch MacBook Pro main development machine (which is really heavy) at the office for work project development. Although I can synchronize code through GitHub and GitLab, and files through OneDrive and iCloud, I still felt like I was maintaining two desktop development environments every day. Some configuration environment changes required double the workload, bringing a significant mental burden.</p>
<p>Moreover, the M1 Max chip machine at home performs far better than the old Intel MacBook Pro laptop. So, I started to explore solutions for accessing home devices remotely via the public network and practiced a thin client workflow. This article is a record and summary of this workflow.</p>

<p>I was inspired by this episode of the <a href="https://teahour.fm">&ldquo;Teahour&rdquo;</a> Podcast: <a href="https://teahour.fm/95">&quot;#95 - What&rsquo;s it like to develop on a Chromebook?&quot;</a>, where I first learned about the thin client development model.</p>
<h3 id="basic-concepts">Basic Concepts</h3>
<p>Thin client development is an increasingly popular development model. Its main idea is that the development input devices you use (such as laptops, tablets, etc.) do not install various development environments. Instead, they use terminal, VS Code Remote, or Jetbrains Client and other client programs as entry points to connect to your remote host or server. This method has the following advantages:</p>
<ol>
<li>It can simplify your development environment to the greatest extent. You only need a terminal and a browser to complete most development work, which can reduce device costs. You can even use a Chromebook or iPad to complete daily development work.</li>
<li>It reduces office location restrictions. You can carry portable devices and work freely in cafes or other places. Compared to running various development environments locally, this method also has longer battery life.</li>
<li>No matter which device you use for development access, you can ensure that your development environment and progress remain consistent, reducing environment synchronization and maintenance costs.</li>
<li>Often our development environment is macOS or Windows operating system. Sometimes the local development environment may have some differences from the actual project running environment. Remote development in a Linux system can effectively reduce these differences and improve development efficiency.</li>
<li>We can concentrate most of our costs on a relatively powerful device to meet long-term development needs.</li>
<li>When there are temporary development needs, we can start and stop some cloud servers as needed, saving costs and improving development efficiency.</li>
<li>In fields like Deep Learning that require specific devices such as GPUs for computation, development cannot be done on local machines.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="my-thin-client-workflow">My Thin Client Workflow</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/thin_client_structure.png" alt="thin_client_structure"></p>
<p>To reduce costs, my thin client workflow is mainly based on an internal network penetration solution I set up myself (the scheme principle and setup method will be explained in detail later). It accesses the more powerful host and server at home from various clients in the public network to complete the main development work.</p>
<p>My main devices on the client side are currently:</p>
<ol>
<li>16-inch MacBook Pro, long-term placement in the office, used as a work machine, mainly for browsing web pages, documents, and connecting to various remote hosts or servers for development work through the iTerm2 terminal tool, and managing code and projects through Git.</li>
<li>Google Pixelbook Go, mainly used in coffee shops, on the couch at home, or other places for some technical learning, blog writing, or personal project development.</li>
</ol>
<p>My servers are divided into the following categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>Mac Studio host, connected to power and always on, is my main server. It is accessible to clients from the public network through internal network penetration. When working or studying at home, it can also be used as a client to connect to other server hosts when connected to a display and keyboard/mouse.</li>
<li>Raspberry Pi, installed with Ubuntu system as the main service running and debugging environment, mainly running some services, accessible to clients from the public network through internal network penetration.</li>
<li>Personal Alibaba Cloud ECS, Tencent Cloud lightweight server, or other project development environments provided by the company, mainly used for running and debugging some project services, such as chain environments.</li>
<li>GitHub Codespaces, participated in the internal test. GitHub provides running environments for up to 10 personal projects. I mainly use it for Solidity, Rust, or front-end learning project development. This way, I can ensure a consistent environment when connecting from different machines or even browsers, without having to reconfigure and set up myself. However, for security considerations, I won&rsquo;t run work projects or some projects involving personal sensitive information.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="my-thin-client-development-experience">My Thin Client Development Experience</h3>
<p>The thin client is not just an optimization of tools and techniques; its original intention is a kind of &ldquo;minimalism&rdquo; in work mode. After practicing this development mode for several months, I can clearly feel that the time I spend on debugging and maintaining the development environment has decreased, and I&rsquo;ve put more attention on the code and services themselves. The seamless switching between &ldquo;instant use&rdquo; and &ldquo;on-demand&rdquo; modes also allows me to switch work states and projects at any time, greatly reducing time costs such as environment cold start and configuration.</p>
<p>Although I have my own pursuit of software and hardware user experience, I&rsquo;m not a person who pursues extremes in all aspects. Instead, I follow a &ldquo;Just Enough&rdquo; philosophy, satisfying my current usage needs. For example, in terms of network environment, I just have an ordinary 100M broadband network environment at home, and I haven&rsquo;t deliberately tinkered with bandwidth and routers. Overall, whether it&rsquo;s typing input or obtaining real-time display, the network latency during operation is almost negligible (my main usage scenario is using VS Code Remote or iTerm2 terminal tool on macOS system to connect to remote hosts or servers for development via SSH, and occasionally using Termius&rsquo;s SFTP function for file transfer, for reference). There are almost no disconnections due to network environment.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve only used VNC for remote desktop control when configuring the Raspberry Pi, and haven&rsquo;t performed other operations that are highly dependent on the graphical interface. The network latency is acceptable but not highly recommended.</p>
<h2 id="network-remote-access-requirement-analysis">Network Remote Access Requirement Analysis</h2>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/raspberry_pi.jpg" alt="raspberry_pi"></p>
<p>Regarding the schemes and principles of remote network access, the article <a href="https://sspai.com/prime/story/remote-lan-access-guide-01">&ldquo;Remote LAN Access Guide&rdquo;</a> on Sspai has already detailed and evaluated various schemes. I only consider the ease of use and cost of the scheme according to personal needs. You can read and choose the appropriate scheme yourself.</p>
<p>First, I sorted out the network conditions and requirements.</p>
<p>Network conditions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Short-term broadband casually set up for renting, no public IP provided, applying for one is probably very troublesome.</li>
<li>The home wireless router seems to be just an ordinary Xiaomi one, haven&rsquo;t tinkered with it much.</li>
<li>Due to work and personal development needs, I have long-term renewed servers on Alibaba Cloud and Tencent Cloud, with public IPs.</li>
</ol>
<p>Remote connection requirements:</p>
<ol>
<li>Access the Mac Studio host via SSH through the public network, and be able to open specific ports when needed.</li>
<li>Access the Raspberry Pi via SSH through the public network, and be able to open specific ports when needed.</li>
<li>Require stable and fast connection, and try to reuse existing software and services to avoid additional expenses.</li>
<li>Easy to expand new devices (such as purchasing new Raspberry Pis) and configure new port mappings (opening new services).</li>
<li>Because the home network is completely managed by Surge as a software router, configurations such as closing DHCP have already been made, so try not to make configurations at the optical modem and router level.</li>
<li>Be able to monitor the connection status of the home network environment and the resource status of the Raspberry Pi server in real time.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="frp-internal-network-penetration-solution">frp Internal Network Penetration Solution</h2>
<p>After some research, I chose the open-source project <a href="https://github.com/fatedier/frp">&ldquo;GitHub - fatedier/frp&rdquo;</a>. According to its official documentation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>frp is a high-performance reverse proxy application focusing on intranet penetration. It supports multiple protocols like TCP, UDP, HTTP, HTTPS. It can securely and conveniently expose intranet services to the public network through nodes with public IP. By deploying frp server on nodes with public IP, intranet services can be easily penetrated to the public network, while providing many professional functional features.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This perfectly meets my needs. I only need to reuse my purchased Alibaba Cloud server with a public IP as a transit server, deploy the frp server, expose the corresponding ports, deploy the frp client on home devices that need to be accessed from the public network and perform port mapping, to achieve internal network penetration.</p>
<h3 id="solution-architecture">Solution Architecture</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/frp_structure.png" alt="frp_structure"></p>
<p>First, I deployed the frp server on my server with a public IP and exposed the corresponding ports.</p>
<p>In my home intranet environment, there are mainly two devices that are always connected to power and turned on, a Mac Studio host and a Raspberry Pi server with Ubuntu operating system, mainly connected to the wireless router via network cable/Wi-Fi. I installed and ran the frp client on both machines according to the official instructions, configured to connect to the frp server, and mapped the service ports that need to be opened (such as mapping the SSH service port 22 of the Raspberry Pi to port 6002 of the Alibaba Cloud server). It&rsquo;s worth mentioning that because the frp client actively sends requests to the server, there&rsquo;s no need to reconfigure even if the network environment changes, as long as its network environment can access the transit server where the frp server is installed.</p>
<p>At this point, my Alibaba Cloud transit server can expose our intranet environment and services to the public network environment. When I&rsquo;m at the office, I can use a laptop, tablet, or phone to access through the public network of the Alibaba Cloud server + the corresponding service port, such as remotely SSH connecting to Mac Studio for development work via terminal.</p>
<p>At the same time, we want to monitor the status of the home network environment and the two hosts in real time for maintenance. I used the Surge macOS client as a software router to manage all devices in the home network, and used the cloud notification function of the Surge iOS client to monitor the home network status in real time. In addition, I used the ServerCat software to monitor the resources of the Raspberry Pi server at home, even down to the temperature, which is no different from the cloud server experience.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/servercat_monitor_raspberry_pi.png" alt="servercat_monitor_raspberry_pi"></p>
<p>The configuration of frp is relatively simple, just follow the official documentation. My configuration process is as follows.</p>
<h3 id="frp-server-configuration">frp Server Configuration</h3>
<p>My Alibaba Cloud is installed with CentOS operating system, other Linux distributions are similar.</p>
<h4 id="service-installation-and-configuration">Service Installation and Configuration</h4>
<p>First log in to the terminal of the Alibaba Cloud server, and install and download the frp program through the following commands (note that you need to download the version corresponding to your operating system from the <a href="https://github.com/fatedier/frp/releases">releases</a> page of the <a href="https://github.com/fatedier/frp">&ldquo;GitHub - fatedier/frp&rdquo;</a> project, decompress and enter the directory.</p>

<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/raspberry_pi.jpg" alt="raspberry_pi"></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a full year since I started working in Beijing after my internship.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been a person with an inexplicable sense of ritual. At this juncture, I frequently reflect on my thoughts, gains, anxieties, and regrets from this past year. I often wonder, on this day a year ago, what would that nervous yet expectant version of myself have hoped to gain from the year ahead?</p>
<p>So, in this piece, let&rsquo;s discuss work, anxiety, and growth.</p>
<h2 id="on-work">On Work</h2>
<h3 id="starting-the-job">Starting the Job</h3>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t particularly diligent in my job search, perhaps because even in Beijing, there weren&rsquo;t many blockchain companies to choose from. While quarantining in a hotel in Shenzhen after returning from Hong Kong, I only participated in about five or six interviews, though some left quite an impression.</p>
<p>One company had no conventional process. The first round involved sharing my screen with an American interviewer, spending two hours writing, testing, and deploying an ERC20 Token smart contract. The second round required writing a system-level scheduled task using a Shell script. Another company asked many questions about EVM low-level optimization and how to avoid infinite loops in contracts.</p>
<p>The company I ultimately chose had two technical leaders jointly conducting the interview. One asked questions related to Go language, while the other inquired about Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum (I later learned he was a former developer from the IBM Fabric team). We also discussed many topics related to future development directions, lasting nearly an hour and a half, followed by a half-hour algorithm test.</p>
<p>I genuinely enjoy and cherish opportunities to gain new engineering knowledge from interviews or to communicate relatively equally with interviewers. It allows me to learn quickly or at least gain some clarity on directions.</p>
<p>After arriving in Beijing, I attended an HR interview and officially joined as an intern, thus beginning my first formal technical internship.</p>
<h3 id="internship">Internship</h3>
<p>Upon first encountering a technical position, the initial trepidation outweighed the novelty. I lacked confidence in transitioning from theoretical knowledge in school to practical enterprise engineering. I had only studied Go language for a few months to prepare for interviews and had never even participated in writing a production application.</p>
<p>As a newcomer to the CRUD realm, I started by writing business interfaces under the guidance of our leader, Brother Cheng, to familiarize myself with the work. We mainly developed a BaaS platform, writing seven interfaces over two weeks, repeatedly testing and optimizing complex SQL queries. I also fully experienced the git commit standards, code review, and code merging processes. It was quite an enjoyable process, seeing my code running in production projects and quickly applying various learned knowledge in work to get real-time feedback, as well as a team working together towards a common goal and milestone.</p>
<p>After completing the main development work for this project, I wanted to do some chain-related development. So I applied to participate in another group&rsquo;s project on optimizing the performance of a self-developed chain smart contract execution engine. However, unfamiliar with Java, I could only attempt to write some tests while studying and researching the theory. This was the blog post I recorded at the time, &ldquo;Ethereum MPT (Merkle Patricia Tries) Explained in Detail&rdquo;. It was during this period that I realized how quickly those dry algorithm principles from LeetCode would actually be put to use.</p>
<p>Perhaps due to being an intern, the work pace wasn&rsquo;t very fast, leaving plenty of time to explore interesting fields or technologies. I wrote the following blog posts to record my learnings:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2021/09/07/blockchain_baas_platform/">Introduction and Architecture of Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) Platform</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2021/09/08/blockchain_consensus/">Distributed Systems and Blockchain Consensus Mechanisms</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2021/09/06/blockchain_crosschain/">Cross-Chain Technology Principles and Practice</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2021/09/09/blockchain_crosschain_bitxhub/">Source Code Analysis of BitXHub Cross-Chain Plugin (Fabric)</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Interestingly, because the company didn&rsquo;t have an internal content publishing platform, I often submitted articles to our competitors&rsquo; blockchain technology blog platforms during this period and received learning feedback from their core technical personnel. I benefited greatly in the cross-chain area, which also made me feel the openness of technology.</p>
<p>At this point, I hadn&rsquo;t decided whether to stay, and I had some contact with other desirable companies. However, soon after, I participated in another cross-chain project with another leader, Brother Tao. As I interacted with him more, I saw the enthusiasm and infinite possibilities of a technologist. We both loved tinkering with various novel tools and technologies, often sharing with each other. Knowing that I often felt anxious about lacking sufficient engineering experience and ability, he involved me in various project practices, sometimes even leading me in pair programming on weekends.</p>
<p>He is a core developer of <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/cello">Hyperledger Cello</a> and encouraged me to participate in open source. A sentence he said at the time still remains vivid in my memory. The gist was that as a technologist, besides completing one work task after another, one always needs to have several labels in their technical career, such as &ldquo;core contributor to a certain open source project&rdquo; and so on. I also need to continuously strive to find my own labels. This point deeply influenced me, and in subsequent work and study, I began to continuously pay attention to and slowly participate in the open source community.</p>
<p>An irreplaceable leader became a more significant factor influencing my choice, so without much hesitation, I stayed.</p>
<h3 id="work">Work</h3>
<p>Soon after, I participated in what was strictly my first complete project, which also occupied most of my first year of work - a underlying cross-chain project.</p>
<p>Perhaps due to my previous after-hours study and understanding of cross-chain, I inexplicably became the project leader just as I transitioned from intern to probationary employee. I participated in technical solution discussions, early system design, underlying chain development and modification, development process standardization, use of DevOps environments, explanations and demonstrations, as well as project delivery-related documentation and communication work. This brought pressure and anxiety I had never anticipated at the start of my work, but it also brought about my rapid growth.</p>
<p>Daytime meetings could last half a day, leaving only evenings to concentrate on writing code. Staying up late or even all night became the norm to meet project milestones. Technical difficulties could stall progress for days, yet I had to juggle other development task schedules simultaneously. Accompanying this were many emotional suppressions and loss of control over life rhythms.</p>
<p>But when I truly completed the final delivery of this project with the team, that sense of joy and achievement was unprecedented. This might have special significance for me. From my undergraduate English major to studying abroad and switching to computer science, I often felt frustrated during many course studies and questioned more than once whether I could continue on this path. Although the process of this project was bumpy, we ultimately succeeded, which gave me tremendous confidence.</p>
<h3 id="interactions">Interactions</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth mentioning the mode of interaction between people after starting work. I seem to have never shed that student air about me, always communicating in a rather direct and candid manner whether facing leaders, colleagues, or project partners. When my life experienced some changes in May, team members took on more work responsibilities to allow me time to adjust. A client leader from a recently completed project would call me for three to four hours to comfort me. And a leader from another ongoing project was helping me apply for a business trip to ease my mood a bit. Work isn&rsquo;t actually as dull as those anxiety-inducing articles describe. I&rsquo;ve always felt that regardless of the environment or occasion, relationships and interactions are mutual. Treating others sincerely can indeed equally gain some trust and sincerity in return.</p>
<h3 id="gains-challenges-and-changes">Gains, Challenges, and Changes</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/dev_guide.png" alt="dev_guide"></p>
<p>A year has passed, and the second project is about to end. I&rsquo;ve learned a lot from this year and wanted to leave something for the department in my own way, so I decided to write a technical guide. In addition to development specifications, it also includes some of my learning records about blockchain over the past few years, as well as some practical records learned from work. These are all things I had hoped to learn when I first entered this job, and I hope to tell new members about them.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/dev_guide_content.png" alt="dev_guide_content"></p>
<p>Although only a year has passed in my work, with much room for improvement and growth in technology and experience, I&rsquo;ve become somewhat confused about direction. I want to delve into underlying blockchain technology, polish the company&rsquo;s or personal products, and participate more in open source construction. But work often leaves me exhausted by project delivery deadlines, making it difficult to have complete time for learning and research. This is a challenge I need to overcome and adjust in my future career.</p>
<p>Fortunately, another leader, Brother Kai, pays great attention to open source and underlying technology. Our occasional exchanges have pointed out some directions for me. There&rsquo;s still much to learn and improve upon; the road of technology is long, with great responsibility and a long way to go.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The above is my summary of work at this point in time. I&rsquo;m gradually enjoying organizing and recording my life, work, and state of mind in this way. I hope that when I look back on this year I&rsquo;m experiencing in the next year, I&rsquo;ll see more changes and growth in myself. Let&rsquo;s encourage each other.</p>

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>In smart contract applications involving interactions between multiple systems or contracts, particularly in businesses where asset or data accuracy is sensitive, we need to ensure data atomicity throughout the entire business process. Therefore, we need to implement a mechanism similar to multi-phase commit at the contract level, which decomposes the state change process in the contract into two phases: pre-commit and formal commit.</p>
<p>This article implements a minimalistic two-phase commit model using a state lock mechanism. The complete contract code can be found at <a href="https://github.com/pseudoyu/learn-solidity/blob/master/practice/two_phase_commit/TwoPhaseCommit.sol">TwoPhaseCommit.sol</a>. The following will explain the core logic of this contract and strive to follow style guidelines and best practices.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: This contract was primarily designed for business use in consortium chains and has not been specifically optimized for gas fees. It is intended for learning purposes only.</p>

<h2 id="contract-logic">Contract Logic</h2>
<h3 id="contract-structure">Contract Structure</h3>
<p>The two-phase commit scenario includes the following methods:</p>
<ol>
<li>set: Two-phase - Pre-commit</li>
<li>commit: Two-phase - Formal commit</li>
<li>rollback: Two-phase - Rollback</li>
</ol>
<p>Due to Solidity language limitations on string length judgment and comparison, to enhance the readability of the contract code, this contract provides some auxiliary methods, mainly including:</p>
<ol>
<li>isValidKey: Check if the key is valid</li>
<li>isValidValue: Check if the value is valid</li>
<li>isEqualString: Compare if two strings are equal</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="two-phase-commit-core-logic">Two-Phase Commit Core Logic</h3>
<p>In the two-phase commit scenario, this contract provides a simple set of <code>set</code>, <code>commit</code>, and <code>rollback</code> methods to store key-value pairs passed in contract calls on the chain. We use a state lock mechanism to achieve atomicity of cross-chain transactions. We define the following data structures:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-solidity" data-lang="solidity"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="kd">enum</span> <span class="nc">State</span> <span class="p">{</span>

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    <span class="n">LOCKED</span>

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Here, <code>State</code> is an enumeration type that records the lock status of the key on the chain, while the <code>Payload</code> structure stores the lock status, current value, and the value being locked. It is bound to the key through the following <code>mapping</code> structure:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-solidity" data-lang="solidity"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="kd">mapping</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">string</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">Payload</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">keyToPayload</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Thus, we can track the state of each key in the contract call based on <code>keyToPayload</code>, and check the state of the key in the following <code>set</code>, <code>commit</code>, and <code>rollback</code> methods for exception handling.</p>
<h4 id="set">set()</h4>
<p>In the <code>set()</code> method, we check the state of the key. If it is <code>State.LOCKED</code>, storage will not be performed and an exception will be thrown:</p>

<p>In contract execution exception scenarios, we throw errors and perform rollbacks. To better improve the readability of error messages and facilitate error capture and handling by upper-layer application personnel, we adopted the error type definition approach, defining various exception scenarios. Since I have already included most of the information in the error naming, no additional parameter values for error types have been defined, which can be customized according to requirements.</p>

<p>The idea of writing a weekly review had been on my mind since before my birthday. I was initially drawn to the open-source weekly reviews by <a href="https://twitter.com/OnlyXuanwo">Xuanwo</a>. On one hand, I aspired to reach a state where I could produce and contribute something every week. On the other hand, I was intrigued by the concept of observing and measuring my life, work, and learning on a weekly scale.</p>
<p>Abandoning thought is always the easiest and most comforting thing to do. Life is already filled with countless trivial matters, noise, and various &ldquo;high-priority&rdquo; tasks. Even when we manage to carve out a complete block of time, we seem to choose to space out and let our minds wander. This is probably the inertia of life. Even as the beginning of this series, the novelty and still-warm flag couldn&rsquo;t resist the force of inertia, and I only started writing two days after the scheduled date.</p>
<p>Although this is positioned as a weekly review, I still want to adopt the form of a complete article covering specific themes, rather than just a pile of bullet points. Perhaps at this stage of life, I will focus more on reflections on emotions and life. In later stages, I might pay more attention to lifestyle and observations on personal development. It may not be necessary for every article to stand at a certain height to point out a direction for myself or provide slogan-like encouragement. I prefer to view it as a form of dialogue.</p>
<p>In this issue, let&rsquo;s talk about emotions, sense of security, and living earnestly.</p>
<h2 id="starting-life-from-zero">Starting Life from Zero</h2>
<p>Although May couldn&rsquo;t be called muddled, it was far from positive. I was avoiding facing various changes in life with all sorts of excuses. From a painful night, I decided to make some adjustments to my living environment and habits, starting from my birthday, to begin living earnestly again as an individual.</p>
<p>In fact, this short phrase has multiple meanings for me: &ldquo;again&rdquo;, &ldquo;as an individual&rdquo;, &ldquo;earnestly&rdquo;, and &ldquo;living&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It seems that it has been a very long time since I managed my own life from a personal perspective, so long that I have lost this &ldquo;skill&rdquo; or &ldquo;habit&rdquo;. In the six or seven years of freely disposable time since college, I seemed to be a person inclined to gain &ldquo;attention&rdquo; from what I was doing, and with a relatively mild personality, I didn&rsquo;t lack social interactions. So for a very long time, I only needed to focus on myself, without casting too much attention on the collection of elements we call &ldquo;life&rdquo; that radiate from my life as the axis.</p>
<p>With the transition from student life to the workplace, when free time and disposable attention were invaded by work and the interactions and socializing that naturally come with this age, I found it harder to find the part that belonged to me.</p>
<p>Being swept along by life seems to be a passive skill cultivated with age. Most people would praise the &ldquo;moving forward&rdquo; part, as if being able to maintain the motivation to move forward at this stage is already commendable. But this is also a thinking trap, a comfort zone composed of satisfaction. Perhaps what we need to overcome is not the squeezed time and energy, but how we fight against anxiety in this state to maintain our original intentions.</p>
<p>Perhaps it&rsquo;s human nature, even without deliberately comparing ourselves with those around us, we&rsquo;re always worried or afraid of a feeling I call &ldquo;Left Behind&rdquo;. In learning, I always tend to continuously acquire new information or understand new technologies, always afraid of the opportunity cost brought by the shift of my focus. There&rsquo;s an abbreviation in the investment circle that fits this point well, &ldquo;FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)&rdquo;. We&rsquo;re always afraid of being the one who misses opportunities, even at the cost of not screening. Fortunately, I have a good degree of freedom to avoid meaningless competition at work. After completing work responsibilities, I will invest more time and energy into some of my own affairs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually a person who doesn&rsquo;t rely much on social interactions, pouring my limited willingness to externalize emotions into those closest to me. But whether it&rsquo;s due to being in a new environment or reaching a certain age, I now seem to slowly start worrying about whether I&rsquo;m too unique to have opportunities to make new friends, and I&rsquo;m afraid of being the one who can&rsquo;t join in conversations in the colleague circle. Although it&rsquo;s not utilitarian, I&rsquo;ve started to face others with a more positive and polished attitude.</p>
<p>Moving forward without direction and original intention may alleviate one&rsquo;s anxiety, but it may bring long-term stagnation or even deviation from the track. The boundary of this part is difficult to grasp, and I seem to have always been not very good at dealing with these things. But to regain control of one&rsquo;s life, one needs to constantly fight against these, and human nature always tends to choose the easy way. So, the biggest enemy is still oneself.</p>
<h2 id="illusion-and-reality-in-relationships">&ldquo;Illusion&rdquo; and &ldquo;Reality&rdquo; in Relationships</h2>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s still difficult to avoid pain and loss when talking about relationships now, but it&rsquo;s gradually time to look back. I saw this sentence before:</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/love_is_illusion.png" alt="love_is_illusion"></p>
<p>In the previous discussion about relationships, &ldquo;<a href="https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2022/06/06/yearly_review_25/">Confessions at 25: A Bouquet-like Love</a>&rdquo;, I mentioned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes, only by desperately changing and adapting can we barely maintain the status quo in life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually, thinking about it later, this is also a luxurious and impossible thing to maintain. The decline of feelings is like the concept of &ldquo;people getting old&rdquo; - although it&rsquo;s common sense, it can only be truly understood when personally experienced. It&rsquo;s like many things happening in life, the drain in the bathroom is clogged, and a little water overflows every time after taking a shower. Maybe it&rsquo;s been like this for a week, maybe longer. Because it doesn&rsquo;t overflow too much to affect the room, just slightly wets the feet and recedes soon, so it hasn&rsquo;t been paid much attention to, and hasn&rsquo;t been fixed; or every time I close the door, I&rsquo;m still very careful to gently close it and look back, afraid that the cat will run out, and it took a while to realize that I&rsquo;ve been away from this home for a long time, it&rsquo;s just a habit. Maybe many things are like this, when staring at a predetermined result, suddenly realizing that it has been happening all along, just that I didn&rsquo;t notice.</p>
<p>Perhaps what I&rsquo;m increasingly realizing about relationships is that memory is not so solid, habits and those most beautiful moments of the past will also become unfamiliar due to the passage of time, and reality is often accelerating this process. And I&rsquo;ve been too reliant on these good feelings, thinking they outweigh everything. Actually, I don&rsquo;t know how to describe the various things after the overlap of fantasy and reality in relationships, just that various memory fragments seem to remind me in various ways that these things and emotions have truly happened. Just like many words once said and remembered or habits formed due to long-term companionship always appear like pranks at certain moments, some parts even seem to have become a symptom.</p>
<p>For example, every evening around six o&rsquo;clock, I always think of what she said when she woke up from a nap at dusk looking out the window, she would feel particularly lonely and sad, as if she was the only person in this world. Maybe I always thought of myself as a strong person, and at that time I couldn&rsquo;t fully empathize, just hoped that every time she woke up like this, I could be with her. And now it seems I&rsquo;ve fallen into such a state, even feeling this loneliness when the surroundings are too quiet or too noisy, of course, that&rsquo;s another topic.</p>
<h2 id="loneliness-and-sense-of-security">Loneliness and Sense of Security</h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier, I didn&rsquo;t seem to be a person who was so afraid of loneliness before, or at least not very sensitive to it. But with the change in life state, my perception of loneliness has become increasingly apparent. Now, no matter what I do, it seems I need to play a podcast or white noise to slightly calm down, while music seems a bit too noisy, to the extent that I can&rsquo;t concentrate on enjoying the melody, but only brings irritability. Perhaps I&rsquo;ve placed too much pursuit of security on emotions, and when this part is missing, the overly protected sense of security dissipates, while the loneliness that coexists with it quickly invades my life. Perhaps for a long time to come, loneliness will be like a friend, always present. I haven&rsquo;t learned how to get along with it yet, but I&rsquo;m gradually getting used to its presence.</p>
<p>Perhaps gradually, I will place these dependencies on close friends, family, or other relationships. This ordinary thing is actually not an easy thing for me in the past. Whether out of fear of troubling others or so-called self-insistence, I seem to have a kind of self-protection even when facing relatives or the most trusted friends, and have a tendency to &ldquo;report only the good news, not the bad&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m always unwilling to actively admit my weaknesses or share my emotions. This has nothing to do with familiarity, I just seem to be accustomed to showing all of myself in an intimate relationship, and sadly, many stages of love rely on fantasy and feelings, often unable to bear the side effects brought by a complete sense of reality. This is not to say that relationships need to be concealed or performed, but that relationships are not a perfect carrier for entrusting a sense of security. The part that relies on sensibility and atmosphere needs a certain distance and imagination to construct, and similarly needs to grasp its boundaries and balance.</p>
<h2 id="learning-input-and-output">Learning, Input and Output</h2>
<p>This part will record some of the various audio-visual books I&rsquo;ve seen, interesting things I&rsquo;ve tinkered with, and some progress in work and study. Fortunately, according to the article &ldquo;<a href="https://reorx.com/blog/sharing-my-footprints-automation/">Using Automated Workflows to Aggregate Information Intake and Output</a>&rdquo;, I&rsquo;ve set up my own &ldquo;<a href="https://t.me/pseudoyulife">Yu&rsquo;s Life Channel</a>&rdquo;, which automatically collects some of my active output and input, such as Twitter, Blog, bookmarks, and GitHub activities, which is very convenient for my weekly review.</p>
<h3 id="technical-learning">Technical Learning</h3>
<p>This week I started to return to the office, still not quite used to it after working from home for nearly two months, but being able to go out is also a good thing for emotional state. Because the project is about to end, the workload itself is not very large, but this week I need to familiarize myself with the fabric environment and some operations. Even if I&rsquo;m not very interested, it&rsquo;s still a very important part of work after all.</p>
<p>Recently, I&rsquo;ve been mainly learning Solidity and Rust development, but this week because I went to the office, there was little complete time, and progress was general, need to re-plan. Then I plan to start re-learning and recording CSAPP, it&rsquo;s time to settle down and supplement some of my technical and underlying knowledge.</p>
<p>This week I had some interesting discussions about blockchain and technology with a Leader, which also provided some reference for my future learning direction. The technology road is still very long, continue to work hard.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/discuss_about_blockchain_in_twitter.png" alt="discuss_about_blockchain_in_twitter"></p>
<h3 id="input">Input</h3>
<p>I sorted out my GitHub Star list and projects, categorized some parts, and recorded them in Pinboard in the form of tags for management. I transferred some read-later items to Instapaper, which is now a relatively closed input flow. In practice, this way I&rsquo;ve read quite a lot of valuable and nutritious content, and in the future, I need to focus more on in-depth learning in some fields.</p>
<p>In terms of audio-visual, this week I mainly watched &ldquo;Mr. Robot&rdquo;, an American TV series I watched a long time ago. I found it interesting, so I rewatched the first few seasons and watched the latest season; As for books, I haven&rsquo;t finished &ldquo;Lolita&rdquo; from before, I&rsquo;m slowly reading it during commutes, because of working from home, it&rsquo;s been put aside for a long time.</p>
<h3 id="output">Output</h3>
<p>Writing is also the hobby that I&rsquo;ve persisted with the longest and has been most effective, and I&rsquo;ve even earned some unexpected remuneration. This week, besides work, I published an article &ldquo;<a href="https://sspai.com/post/73934">In 2022, Why Am I Still Blogging</a>&rdquo; on Sspai, which received good feedback. I met many people who are also blogging, exchanged with them, and by the way, improved the blog data statistics system. In addition, I received another commissioned article about blockchain, but it&rsquo;s about stablecoin-related content that I&rsquo;m not very familiar with, so I can do some research and learning first.</p>
<h3 id="software-and-hardware-optimization">Software and Hardware Optimization</h3>
<p>This week, I mainly moved the n8n service deployment to Railway via docker, so I don&rsquo;t have to worry about service anomaly issues anymore, it will be a more stable system.</p>
<p>I achieved intranet penetration at home using frp, so I can directly ssh remote connect to the Mac Studio that&rsquo;s always on at home from the office or when I&rsquo;m out with just a Chromebook for development. Later I also plan to set up a Raspberry Pi, which can save a lot of cloud server costs, and I also want to tinker with some interesting things like temperature and humidity sensors.</p>
<p>The DJI RS3 camera stabilizer arrived, I tinkered with it and learned the basic operations, but I&rsquo;m not very familiar with the balancing part, will slowly learn to use it later, can shoot more.</p>
<p>The new keyboard Leopold FC660C arrived, I like both its appearance and feel, it&rsquo;s become the main keyboard at home now, and I took the HHKB to the office.</p>
<h2 id="habits-interests-and-changes">Habits, Interests and Changes</h2>
<p>I find it hard to define whether I&rsquo;m a person who likes change. I&rsquo;m happy to accept new things and can adapt to a new environment relatively quickly, but for many familiar daily routines or parts that I still have attachment and emotional investment in, I try very hard to keep them in their original state. The layout of the home, the style of dress, even the order of color schemes in the wardrobe, I&rsquo;ve retained the original state as if I have obsessive-compulsive disorder. Even some of my behavioral patterns and habits in life, I seem unwilling to change. I find it hard to define these behaviors of mine, perhaps it&rsquo;s an obsession with the past or changes that I&rsquo;m unwilling to accept.</p>
<p>But actually, making some changes and attempts is also a very interesting thing, and it&rsquo;s also suitable for exploring new lifestyles or interests. This part will also record some of my attempts and progress in cultivating interests.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Input method</strong>. I tried switching to Xiaohe Shuangpin, which I&rsquo;ve been interested in for a long time but never had the patience to practice. It&rsquo;s not really for how much improvement in typing speed, but I feel it&rsquo;s an interesting experience to make a change to a habit I&rsquo;ve (passively) insisted on for more than ten years. It&rsquo;s been about three weeks, the speed hasn&rsquo;t returned to that of full pinyin, but the rhythm of typing has improved a lot. More importantly, it seems that I&rsquo;ve experienced the joy and pleasure brought by improvement from typing, which is hard to imagine could be obtained from something I&rsquo;ve been doing for more than ten years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Video editing</strong>. I&rsquo;ve always wanted to do some shooting and editing. Although because of previous work and some daily interests, I&rsquo;ve never been able to do any complete creation, maybe more is the cultivation of skills. I plan to start doing some shooting and editing, and by the way, learn how to use the stabilizer properly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong>. I feel I&rsquo;ve been staying at home for too long and haven&rsquo;t exercised for a long time. I plan to start doing some daily exercises with Ring Fit Adventure, and when the weather is better, I can go skateboarding, at least maintain a relatively stable frequency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Language</strong>. English reading and writing are used a lot in daily work and study, but I want to improve more in spoken language, and need to have a stable practice frequency; As for Japanese, I haven&rsquo;t continued after finishing the New Standard Japanese Elementary level, I need to start doing some review and preparation as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Music</strong>. I sent the guitar at home over, after learning for a while in freshman year, it&rsquo;s been put aside for a long time. I plan to do some practice later, at least music is an art that can make people relax and calm down, but it needs practice and persistence. I will also record some of the practice process and small works in video form.</p>

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>Recently, I published several articles introducing my blog setup process and components. Many friends followed my tutorial and set up their own blogs. Meanwhile, some friends raised questions: In 2022, with so many mature writing and publishing platforms available, why do we still go to such lengths to set up and update our own blogs?</p>
<p>I started writing on WeChat Official Account in my freshman year (2015), sharing articles about books, movies, and personal life. In 2018, I began using <a href="https://wordpress.com/">Wordpress</a> to build my personal blog, which I migrated to <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> + <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> in 2019 and have maintained ever since.</p>
<p>Over these two years, I&rsquo;ve updated 70 articles, mainly including course notes, technology, and efficiency-related topics. Since setting up my own website statistics system, there have been nearly 10,000 visitors. In this article, I want to share with you my thoughts on blogging from my personal experience, which might provide some reference for those who are hesitating.</p>
<h2 id="the-initial-intention-and-value-of-blogging">The Initial Intention and Value of Blogging</h2>
<h3 id="publishing-study-notes">Publishing Study Notes</h3>
<p>Perhaps due to my passion for Chinese literature in middle and high school and the influence of my English major in university, I&rsquo;ve always enjoyed reading and sharing. Long ago, I maintained a personal WeChat Official Account with an old friend, writing articles about books, movies, music, and personal life. This was my first time conveying my emotions through words, and I experienced the joy and touch brought by external feedback.</p>
<p>Later, for various reasons, the Official Account stopped updating, and I hadn&rsquo;t published articles publicly for a long time. However, because I had the idea of changing majors at that time, I was constantly learning new knowledge on my own and would regularly record notes and learning insights in my note-taking software, gradually developing a habit of recording.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/hku_course.jpg" alt="hku_course"></p>
<p>Especially during my study in Hong Kong, because the courses were taught entirely in English, I needed to spend a lot of time reviewing and organizing after class. I also shared with many classmates, so I picked up the long-abandoned blog and successively published many study notes, receiving positive feedback and thanks from many classmates. Later, I added components such as website visit statistics and comments. Occasionally checking, I would be pleasantly surprised to find many visitors from search engines, which provided me with a lot of motivation to continue updating.</p>
<p>Blog articles are different from scattered knowledge points. They require specific themes, certain writing structures, and complete content. This prompts me to sort out and summarize my knowledge system when conceiving and writing, sometimes needing to use mind maps and flowcharts to aid understanding. This process constantly reinforces the knowledge points I&rsquo;ve learned and helped me through many assignments and exams.</p>
<p>Although not many people read it in the early stages, I viewed it as my channel of expression and a window to gain recognition and value. Therefore, writing an article required a lot of effort, making me more disciplined in giving up many meaningless distractions and investing more time in polishing my articles. Moreover, the time pressure also promoted my thinking about learning methods and efficiency, naturally understanding and thinking from the perspective of the entire knowledge structure when listening to lectures or reading materials.</p>
<h3 id="recording-work-insights">Recording Work Insights</h3>
<p>After starting work, because the blockchain industry I&rsquo;m engaged in is an emerging field, sometimes a small knowledge point requires consulting many scattered materials to understand, and most of them come from blog posts of industry experts. Sometimes I would follow a blogger&rsquo;s article timeline from the beginning, gaining a lot. At this time, I also had the idea of recording and sharing these pitfalls I encountered in my work and study.</p>
<p>I found that most blockchain-related materials online are relatively brief and biased towards the underlying layer, without very detailed step-by-step explanations, which is not very reproducible for beginners. So, I began to regularly organize my learning insights and work experiences into themes and publish them on <a href="https://www.pseudoyu.com">my blog</a>, and separately extracted blockchain-related content into a <a href="https://www.pseudoyu.com/blockchain-guide/">beginner&rsquo;s guide</a> for everyone to learn and exchange.</p>
<p>After publishing, I received a lot of feedback and met many like-minded people through this, establishing my own relationship network, gaining a deeper understanding of my learning and career development, and even getting some interesting opportunities.</p>
<p>After working for a while, I became the technical lead for some projects and needed to quickly onboard the team to the projects. At this time, these blog posts of mine could serve as shared training materials with team members, greatly reducing repetitive workload and also pushing myself to maintain a stable output rhythm. In addition, because of this attitude of willingness to share, I was also assigned to build a technical team documentation library with the team leader, which promoted information dissemination and business development within the department and even the company, and also helped my career development to some extent.</p>
<h3 id="sharing-efficiency-tips">Sharing Efficiency Tips</h3>
<p>In my spare time, I&rsquo;m also an efficiency enthusiast who loves to tinker with various tool applications and maintains a &ldquo;<a href="https://github.com/pseudoyu/yu-tools">pseudoyu/yu-tool Personal Toolbox</a>&rdquo; project. Over time, many friends would come to me with software and hardware related questions, such as &ldquo;What good software can achieve this function?&rdquo; or &ldquo;How do I download and install this?&rdquo; and so on. I would answer them one by one, but because I don&rsquo;t use some software as frequently myself, my memory of the details might be biased. Therefore, I would make detailed records of my software system setup and usage process, organize them into blog posts and publish them for my own future reference or direct sharing with friends who need them.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/yu_new_desk_setup.jpg" alt="yu_new_desk_setup"></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always felt that recording software and hardware and these tinkering processes is not just a pile of cold items and screenshots, but a transmission of my personal values, lifestyle, and way of thinking, as I felt in another article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But when I use the system that I initially spent a lot of thought researching and optimizing in my daily work and study, or when a sudden need uses a software/configuration that I tinkered with before, I feel inexplicably happy and accomplished. This is probably the meaning of tinkering.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="personal-reflection-and-growth">Personal Reflection and Growth</h3>
<p>After going through various stages and roles in my studies and work, I found that I might have completely different thoughts and growth at different stages and roles, and sometimes looking back can be very touching. Therefore, I set up a &ldquo;<a href="https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/category/ideas/">Thoughts</a>&rdquo; section, where I would record my growth on my birthday every year, and also record my thoughts at some specific time points. In the future, I will also record some of my stage insights in the form of weekly/monthly reports.</p>
<p>I believe that my future self, even after several months or years, can find my state of mind at that time from these bits and pieces of records. When one gradually cultivates the habit of recording life, it also allows one to pay attention to and feel the beauty of life, and to face challenges from the future more positively.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/warm_comments.png" alt="warm_comments"></p>
<p>A personal blog is like one&rsquo;s own tree hole. While recording and expressing one&rsquo;s emotions, one might also receive some warmth from strangers.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-persist-in-writing">How to Persist in Writing</h2>
<h3 id="overcoming-psychological-barriers">Overcoming Psychological Barriers</h3>
<p>Writing is not an easy thing. When I haven&rsquo;t picked up the pen for a long time, I often feel &ldquo;out of touch&rdquo;. Friends who didn&rsquo;t have a writing habit before might find it easier to feel &ldquo;don&rsquo;t know what to write&rdquo;, &ldquo;what I write is meaningless&rdquo; or &ldquo;will anyone read it&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This is actually a misunderstanding. There&rsquo;s a saying, &ldquo;The master must please himself&rdquo;. Writing (especially personal blog writing) should not be a strongly purposeful thing, but a process of self-recording, self-discovery, self-exploration, and self-expression. Each of us plays different roles and has our own unique perspective and way of looking at things. As long as we pay more attention to our own or interested fields, collect fragmented ideas, think actively, explore interesting ideas using methods like mind maps, organize these ideas into articles, carefully polish our articles, and express them with a sincere attitude, we can create valuable content.</p>
<h3 id="actively-sharing-and-spreading">Actively Sharing and Spreading</h3>
<p>After completing the article, we can choose to publish and spread it on various platforms, actively obtain positive feedback, which will also promote ourselves to be more motivated to persist. In addition to personal blogs, we can choose content communities like Jianshu, Zhihu, Weibo, or some relatively vertical content platforms like Sspai, Jike, etc.</p>
<p>Good content will naturally spread and be seen by more people. What we need to do is to persist and continue to output. In the early stage, we can set a fixed frequency for ourselves, such as half a month/one month, give ourselves some small material incentives, and then slowly adjust according to our own situation and wishes in the later stage.</p>
<h2 id="personal-blog">Personal Blog</h2>
<h3 id="why-choose-a-personal-blog">Why Choose a Personal Blog</h3>
<p>The above text focused on how we write valuable blog articles. Now, let&rsquo;s return to the question at the beginning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since there are so many platforms already, why do we still choose to set up a personal blog?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After the popularization of mobile internet and smartphones, the term &ldquo;blogger&rdquo; seems to have become a tear of the times. Some time ago, I was even added to a list of &ldquo;Salute to friends who are still blogging&rdquo;, which made me laugh and cry.</p>
<p>With the rapid development of the internet, we have more channels of expression, but we seem to have lost the desire to express. Moments, Weibo, etc. seem to be suitable first positions for emotional expression, but character limits and too many social connections make us hesitate; while platforms like Zhihu and Jianshu seem too &ldquo;professional&rdquo; and are not suitable for all content, and are easily influenced by online public opinion.</p>
<p>A personal blog is a more perfect choice. We can customize each module of the blog according to our preferences at will, and the process of tinkering and optimizing is like decorating our own little room, which is very fulfilling. Coupled with a personal domain name, we can also build our personal brand. Putting our personal website link on personal social platforms or job resumes is a good bonus point.</p>
<p>Another important point is that the content and data we publish on the blog belong to us, and will not lose all data or experience the pain of large-scale migration with the demise of the platform. Having experienced the painful lesson of the demise of &ldquo;Xiami Music&rdquo;, I pay particular attention to this point and regularly back up my article data.</p>
<p>In addition, we can do some SEO optimization for personal blogs without being influenced by the algorithms of content platforms. Readers may link from one article to other expressions of their own ideas and attitudes, letting them feel that behind the text is a real, interesting person, not just a homogeneous knowledge molecule of the internet.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-set-up-a-personal-blog">How to Set Up a Personal Blog</h3>
<p>My personal blog was originally built on my own Vultr VPS using WordPress. Because the network access was relatively slow, I migrated it to Tencent Cloud server and got it registered. Although the access speed improved, the process of publishing blogs was very cumbersome, and the maintenance of the server was a considerable expense in the long term.</p>
<p>Therefore, I have been exploring a solution that can ensure both domestic and foreign access experience, and can be hosted on some platforms to optimize the deployment and publishing process. Later, I&rsquo;ve been constantly improving the blog system setup and publishing process. So far, I&rsquo;m quite satisfied with my full-process solution. Although some configuration is needed for deployment and setup, subsequent updates and maintenance are very convenient. I&rsquo;ve written a series of articles about the blog setup process.</p>
<h4 id="blog-setup-and-automatic-publishing-system">Blog Setup and Automatic Publishing System</h4>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/yu_blog_homepage_20240629.png" alt="yu_blog_homepage_20240629"></p>
<p>I use Hugo, a static website generator, to build my personal blog. Hugo is a blogging tool implemented in Go, using Markdown for article editing, automatically generating static site files, supporting rich theme configuration, and can also embed plugins like comment systems through js, highly customizable.</p>
<p>In addition, I version control the blog configuration and source files of all articles, coupled with GitHub Action for automated deployment, automatically generating static sites and pushing to the GitHub Pages blog publishing repository. For the setup tutorial, please refer to:</p>

</ul>
<h4 id="blog-comment-system">Blog Comment System</h4>
<p>A complete blog, of course, needs a comment system. Systems like WordPress have their own comment plugins, while static blogs need to interface with comment systems themselves. I initially chose the third-party Disqus, which is simple and easy to use, but comes with a lot of ads and promotions, and is not simple enough. Therefore, I chose Randy&rsquo;s Cusdis, an open-source comment system that focuses on data privacy, and self-deployed it through Railway. For the setup tutorial, please refer to:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2022/05/24/free_and_lightweight_blog_comment_system_using_cusdis_and_railway/">Lightweight Open Source Free Blog Comment System Solution (Cusdis + Railway)</a></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="blog-data-statistics-system">Blog Data Statistics System</h4>
<p>As a continuously updated and operated blog platform, we must be very curious about which article has the highest readership, which keyword is searched most frequently, etc. Data statistics can help us focus on more valuable content creation and sharing.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/splitbee_data.png" alt="splitbee_data"></p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/google_console_data.png" alt="google_console_data"></p>
<p>There are many similar tools. I chose <a href="https://splitbee.io/">splitbee</a> and <a href="https://search.google.com/search-console">Google Console</a> to analyze my visitor information and search weight.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/cloudflare_data.png" alt="cloudflare_data"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a> can also analyze network traffic, but because there is a lot of network-unrelated traffic, such as crawlers, etc., it&rsquo;s not very referential.</p>
<p>In addition, I chose an open-source service umami that can replace Google Analytics, and deployed it through Vercel and Heroku to achieve real-time monitoring of visitor data. For the setup tutorial, please refer to:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2022/05/21/free_blog_analysis_using_umami_vercel_and_heroku/">Build a Free Personal Blog Data Statistics System from Scratch (umami + Vercel + Heroku)</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s 2022, and I&rsquo;m still blogging, and I will continue to persist. The blog is like my private space, each note records my changes and growth, and also carries the most important moments of my life. I hope you in front of the screen can also experience the charm of blogging, and let more friends join our still persevering &ldquo;blogger&rdquo; camp.</p>

<p>After the previous articles on smart contract basics, Web3.py, and ethers.js, we have mastered the fundamental knowledge of interacting directly with blockchain networks through programs. For those unfamiliar, you can review:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>However, in real complex business scenarios, we often use some further encapsulated frameworks, such as HardHat, Brownie, Truffle, etc. HardHat is the most widely used and has the most powerful plugin expansion. This series will focus on the use and best practices of the Hardhat framework starting from this article, and this article will complete its installation, configuration, and use through a simple example.</p>
<p>This article is a summary of learning from <a href="https://twitter.com/PatrickAlphaC">Patrick Collins</a>&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyMwXuJrbJQ">&ldquo;Learn Blockchain, Solidity, and Full Stack Web3 Development with JavaScript&rdquo;</a> tutorial. It is strongly recommended to watch the original tutorial video for more details.</p>
<p>You can click <a href="https://github.com/pseudoyu/learn-solidity/tree/master/hardhat_simple_storage">here</a> to access the code repository for this test demo.</p>
<h2 id="introduction-to-hardhat">Introduction to Hardhat</h2>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/hardhat_homepage.png" alt="hardhat_homepage"></p>
<p>Hardhat is a JavaScript-based smart contract development environment that can be used to flexibly compile, deploy, test, and debug EVM-based smart contracts. It provides a series of toolchains to integrate code with external tools and offers a rich plugin ecosystem to improve development efficiency. In addition, it also provides a local Hardhat network node that simulates Ethereum, offering powerful local debugging capabilities.</p>
<p>Its GitHub address is <a href="https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat">NomicFoundation/hardhat</a>, and you can visit its <a href="https://hardhat.org/getting-started">official documentation</a> to learn more.</p>
<h2 id="using-hardhat">Using Hardhat</h2>
<h3 id="initializing-the-project">Initializing the Project</h3>
<p>To build a Hardhat project from scratch, we need to pre-install <code>node.js</code> and <code>yarn</code> environments. This part can be installed according to the official instructions based on your system environment.</p>
<p>First, we need to initialize the project and install the <code>hardhat</code> dependency package.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">yarn init
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">yarn add --dev hardhat
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/yarn_add.png" alt="yarn_add"></p>
<h3 id="initializing-hardhat">Initializing Hardhat</h3>
<p>Then we need to run <code>yarn hardhat</code> to initialize through interactive commands. Configure according to project needs. For our test demo, we choose the default values.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/hardhat_project_init.png" alt="hardhat_project_init"></p>
<h3 id="optimizing-code-formatting">Optimizing Code Formatting</h3>
<h4 id="vs-code-configuration">VS Code Configuration</h4>
<p>I develop code locally using VS Code. You can format code by installing the <code>Solidity + Hardhat</code> and <code>Prettier</code> plugins. You can open VS Code settings and add the following formatting configuration in <code>settings.json</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-json" data-lang="json"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">{</span>

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    <span class="p">}</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><h4 id="project-configuration">Project Configuration</h4>
<p>To unify the code formatting styles of developers using various projects, we can also configure <code>prettier</code> and <code>prettier-plugin-solidity</code> plugin support for the project:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">yarn add --dev prettier prettier-plugin-solidity
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/yarn_add_prettier_plugin.png" alt="yarn_add_prettier_plugin"></p>
<p>After adding dependencies, you can add <code>.prettierrc</code> and <code>.prettierignore</code> configuration files in the project directory to unify formatting:</p>
<p>My <code>.prettierrc</code> configuration is:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-json" data-lang="json"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">{</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id="compiling-contracts">Compiling Contracts</h3>
<p>There&rsquo;s no need to customize the <code>compile</code> command like in <code>ethers.js</code>. HardHat provides a built-in <code>compile</code> command. You can place contracts in the <code>contracts</code> directory and then compile them using the <code>yarn hardhat compile</code> command:</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/hardhat_compile_contract.png" alt="hardhat_compile_contract"></p>
<h3 id="adding-dotenv-support">Adding <code>dotenv</code> Support</h3>
<p>Before we start writing deployment scripts, let&rsquo;s configure the <code>dotenv</code> plugin. This way, we can use <code>dotenv</code> to get environment variables. During development, we will deal with a lot of private information, such as private keys, etc. We would like to store them in a <code>.env</code> file or set them directly in the terminal, such as our <code>RINKEBY_PRIVATE_TOKEN</code>. This way, we can use <code>process.env.RINKEBY_PRIVATE_TOKEN</code> to get the value in the deployment script without explicitly writing it in the code, reducing the risk of privacy leakage.</p>
<h4 id="installing-dotenv">Installing <code>dotenv</code></h4>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">yarn add --dev dotenv

<h4 id="setting-environment-variables">Setting Environment Variables</h4>
<p>In the <code>.env</code> file, we can set environment variables, such as:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-plaintext" data-lang="plaintext"><span class="line"><span class="cl">RINKEBY_RPC_URL=url
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">RINKEBY_PRIVATE_KEY=0xkey

</span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id="configuring-network-environment">Configuring Network Environment</h3>
<p>Often, our contracts need to run on different blockchain networks, such as local testing, development, and production environments. Hardhat also provides a convenient way to configure network environments.</p>
<h4 id="starting-the-network">Starting the Network</h4>
<p>We can directly run a script to start a network that comes with Hardhat, but this network only exists during script execution. To start a locally sustainable network, you need to run the <code>yarn hardhat node</code> command:</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/hardhat_localhost_node.png" alt="hardhat_localhost_node"></p>
<p>After execution, test networks and test accounts are generated for subsequent development and debugging.</p>
<p>We can also generate our own test network nodes through platforms like Alchemy or Infura, and record their <code>RPC_URL</code> for program connection use.</p>
<h4 id="defining-networks">Defining Networks</h4>
<p>After preparing the network environment, we can define networks in the project configuration <code>hardhat.config.js</code>:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Here we made two special treatments.</p>
<p>First, we only need to verify the contract on the <code>rinkeby</code> network, not on local or other network environments. Therefore, we judge <code>network.config.chainId</code>. If it&rsquo;s <code>4</code>, we perform the verification operation; otherwise, we don&rsquo;t. In addition, we only perform the verification operation when there is an <code>ETHERSCAN_API_KEY</code> environment variable.</p>
<p>Also, Etherscan may need some time after deployment to get the contract address, so we configured <code>.wait(6)</code> to wait for 6 blocks before verification.</p>
<p>The execution effect is as follows:</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/hardhat_verify_contract_etherscan.png" alt="hardhat_verify_contract_etherscan"></p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/verified_contract_on_etherscan.png" alt="verified_contract_on_etherscan"></p>
<p>After verification through Etherscan, we can directly view the contract source code and interact with it.</p>

<h3 id="contract-testing">Contract Testing</h3>
<p>For smart contracts, most operations need to be deployed on-chain, interact with assets, consume gas, and once there are security vulnerabilities, it will cause serious consequences. Therefore, we need to conduct detailed tests on smart contracts.</p>
<p>Hardhat provides comprehensive testing and debugging tools. We can write test scripts in the <code>tests</code> directory and run tests using the <code>yarn hardhat test</code> command.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In Hardhat&rsquo;s test script, we use <code>describe</code> to wrap the test class and use <code>it</code> to wrap the test method. We need to ensure that the contract is deployed before testing, so we use the <code>beforeEach</code> method to call <code>simpleStorageFactory.deploy()</code> before each test method is executed, and assign the returned <code>simpleStorage</code> object to the <code>simpleStorage</code> variable.</p>
<p>We use <code>assert.equal(currentValue.toString(), expectedValue)</code> to compare the execution result with the expected result. It can be replaced with <code>expect(currentValue.toString()).to.equal(expectedValue)</code>, which has the same effect.</p>
<p>In addition, we can use <code>it.only()</code> to specify that only one of the test methods is executed.</p>
<h4 id="running-test-scripts">Running Test Scripts</h4>
<p>We run the test with <code>yarn hardhat test</code> and can specify test methods with <code>yarn hardhat test --grep store</code>.</p>

<h3 id="adding-gas-reporter-support">Adding <code>gas-reporter</code> Support</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, gas is a resource we need to pay special attention to during development, especially expensive on the Ethereum mainnet. Therefore, we need to check gas consumption during testing. HardHat also has a <code>gas-reporter</code> plugin that can conveniently output gas consumption information.</p>
<h4 id="installing-gas-reporter-plugin">Installing <code>gas-reporter</code> Plugin</h4>
<p>We install the plugin using the <code>yarn add --dev hardhat-gas-reporter</code> command:</p>

<h4 id="running-tasks">Running Tasks</h4>
<p>After definition, our newly defined <code>block-number</code> task will appear in the <code>AVAILABLE TASKS</code> of the project command. You can run the task using the <code>yarn hardhat block-number</code> command. Similarly, we can specify a specific network to run:</p>

<h3 id="hardhat-console">Hardhat Console</h3>
<p>Finally, in addition to interacting with the chain/contract through code, we can also debug projects, view chain status, contract input and output, etc. through the <code>Hardhat Console</code>. We can open the Hardhat Console and interact using the <code>yarn hardhat console</code> command.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/hardhat_console.png" alt="hardhat_console"></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The above is my basic configuration and use of the Hardhat framework. It is a very powerful development framework, and I will continue to delve into more of its features and usage techniques in the future. If you&rsquo;re interested, you can continue to follow. I hope this is helpful to everyone.</p>

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>In the previous article &ldquo;<a href="https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2022/05/25/learn_solidity_from_scratch_basic/">Solidity Smart Contract Development - Basics</a>&rdquo;, we learned the basic syntax of Solidity and understood that we can debug using frameworks like <a href="https://github.com/eth-brownie/brownie">Brownie</a> and <a href="https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat">HardHat</a>. In another article &ldquo;<a href="https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2022/05/30/learn_solidity_from_scratch_web3py/">Solidity Smart Contract Development - Mastering Web3.py</a>&rdquo;, we also interacted directly with our local Ganache node using Web3.py.</p>
<p>Originally, because I was more familiar with Python, I planned to use the Brownie framework for subsequent development. However, after some research, I found that the industry predominantly uses the HardHat framework, which also has more extensions. Additionally, the Solidity tutorial I&rsquo;m following has updated to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyMwXuJrbJQ">Javascript version</a>, so I decided to learn it.</p>
<p>To better understand the principles and lay a good foundation for our subsequent use of the framework, this time we will use <a href="https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/">ethers.js</a> to interact with our Rinkeby test network deployed on the <a href="https://dashboard.alchemyapi.io">Alchemy</a> platform. We will implement basic contract compilation, deployment to the Rinkeby network, and interaction with the contract.</p>
<p>You can click <a href="https://github.com/pseudoyu/learn-solidity/tree/master/ethers_simple_storage">here</a> to access the code repository for this test demo.</p>
<h2 id="ethersjs">ethers.js</h2>
<p>ethers.js is an open-source library for Javascript that can interact with the Ethereum network. Its GitHub address is <a href="https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/">ethers.io/ethers.js</a>, and you can visit its <a href="https://docs.ethers.io/">official documentation</a> for usage.</p>
<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>

<h3 id="reading-the-contract-source-file">Reading the Contract Source File</h3>
<p>After completing the Solidity contract writing and syntax checking through VSCode or other editors, we need to compile the contract into abi file and bytecode.</p>
<p>We can install the <code>solc</code> command-line tool through <code>yarn</code> for editing, and we can choose the corresponding version. The command is as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">yarn add solc@0.8.7-fixed
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>After installation, we can use the <code>solcjs</code> command for compilation. The command is as follows:</p>

<p>The above are the steps for interacting with the Rinkeby test network of Alchemy through the <code>ethers.js</code> library. In actual production project development, we generally do not directly use libraries like <code>ethers.js</code>, but instead use further encapsulated frameworks like Brownie and HardHat. However, understanding how to use libraries like <code>Web3.py</code> or <code>ethers.js</code> is also very important. I will further explain the use of the HardHat framework in the future.</p>

<p>Today is June 6, 2022, and I am 25 years old. In truth, since that article I wrote two years ago on this day, &ldquo;Confessions at 23: Pursuing Meaning,&rdquo; I had intended to write one every year, as a way to account for the year past, whether it was splendid or mundane.</p>
<p>Much indeed happened when I was 23, but each time I opened a blank document, I found myself at a loss for words. Unlike high school or university, this year brought many changes: the passing of two close family members, fluctuations in my love life, the pressure of pursuing graduate studies in a different field, the anxiety of job hunting&hellip;</p>
<p>It became difficult to encapsulate these experiences under a clear theme or a few keywords. After struggling several times, I ultimately gave up. I consoled myself, thinking there was still the new year, and when work and my life situation for the foreseeable future became more certain, I would surely have more to say. Yet, I procrastinated until now.</p>
<p>What of this past year, my 24th?</p>

</figure>
<hr>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite interesting to reflect on it. Many things happened this year as well, yet in reminiscing, it can all be encapsulated by the phrase &ldquo;a love like a flower bouquet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To be honest with myself, I am not a person who handles emotions maturely. I pursue self-interest, often fear commitment, and struggle to manage interpersonal boundaries—these &ldquo;player&rdquo; qualities, as they might be called, are all present. Yet, I seem to be a fortunate person, having <del>met</del> once met someone willing to accept and grow alongside me.</p>
<p>This relationship began full of anticipation and beauty—two similar souls with shared goals and passionate interests, walking hand in hand as fellow travelers. For a long time, I was immersed in this state of bliss, even doubting whether I deserved such fortune. After all, I was once truly a flawed person who had done some regrettable things; being forgiven was already a blessing, how could I dare ask for more?</p>
<p>Over the past year, I changed a great deal. I began to think about and look forward to the future, to make promises, no longer fearing changes in my life. Together, we came to Beijing, adopted a cat, saved money, worked hard, adorning our busy yet fulfilling lives. We anticipated a new phase of returning to Hangzhou together, sketching out a future that belonged to us both. I often thought, this must be my perfect love.</p>
<p>However, the most perilous aspects of a relationship are self-satisfied giving and taking things for granted. Perhaps I always considered myself a fairly good boyfriend—present in time and space, working hard, trying to fulfill her desires as much as possible—but maybe that was the extent of it. Thinking back carefully, how long had it been since we opened our hearts to each other? How long since I had meticulously prepared a surprise for a special occasion? How long since we went on a proper date together? Even on the most important birthday, I forgot to light candles and make wishes, postponing it to the next day to make amends. There were so many things I failed to do.</p>
<p>Perhaps there are many reasons to make myself feel a little more at ease. For instance, we had agreed not to do anything superficial, even listing in advance the gifts we wanted to give each other for the coming year. Or that I had been working overtime every weekend for two consecutive months, leaving no energy to plan outings. Or that we had both transitioned from being classmates in the same major who spent every moment together to a new stage of work, with fewer common topics to discuss. Or perhaps&hellip;</p>
<p>It was only after this relationship ended so abruptly that I belatedly realized she might not have found her version of love in it. When the fantasy of love slowly overlapped with reality, when distance diluted the filter of the honeymoon phase, when I invested all my emotions and desire to share in the relationship, perhaps it had already slowly deviated from its original path. Only, I was the one who remained blissfully protected.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/flowers_movie_screenshot.jpg" alt="flowers_movie_screenshot"></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always considered myself not to be a typical romantic, never expecting my life to be as exciting as those in books or movies, simply trying to follow my own feelings and wishes as I move forward. I never imagined I would see so many reflections of my own life in such a film, even glimpsing the ending.</p>
<p>But is it truly impossible for a budding career and love to coexist?</p>
<p>To this day, I still don&rsquo;t believe so. To borrow a line from one of &ldquo;<a href="https://space.bilibili.com/37029661">Xiao Lu Lawrence</a>&rsquo;s&rdquo; videos:</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is actually a person easily satisfied. Feeding a red panda could make her happy for days, or even me not having to work overtime editing videos could make her dance with joy. She would also cry like a fool after watching &lsquo;A Flower Bouquet-like Love.&rsquo; My point of empathy differs from Mr. Mi&rsquo;s; it&rsquo;s when they go to the bookstore, and the male lead keeps reading &lsquo;success&rsquo; books, because I&rsquo;ve been reading management books lately. I understand him because, it&rsquo;s not that we no longer like literature, but sometimes in life, we have to change and adapt desperately just to barely maintain the status quo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sometimes I think, &ldquo;maintaining the status quo&rdquo; is such a beautiful phrase. In some stages of life, we can leisurely feel and enjoy the beauty of love, while in others, merely maintaining requires desperate changes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always felt that the fondness between two people is based on mutual admiration—a heartfelt recognition of each other&rsquo;s personalities, actions, and passions. The admired person feels fulfilled, while the admirer&rsquo;s eyes and gestures radiate light. Perhaps I had placed less focus on the other person&rsquo;s individual actions, perhaps many of my once-attractive qualities had been submerged in the trivialities of life and work, no longer worthy of admiration. There are many perhapses, but regardless of acceptance, at least this phase of our destiny has concluded.</p>
<p>A month has passed imperceptibly, and to my own surprise, I haven&rsquo;t fallen into the expected self-destruction. It&rsquo;s like a line from a drama I recently enjoyed, &ldquo;My Liberation Notes&rdquo;:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I want to break free. I hope my life can truly become happy. So, come and admire me. This way, when spring arrives, both you and I will transform.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In truth, I rarely speak openly about my relationships. I never expected to ramble on so much in this manner. This relationship held great significance for me, and I regret not sharing it at the right moment. Now, it&rsquo;s probably expired sweetness.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still searching for redemption in this relationship or this phase of life. My heart will continue to preserve or rekindle this admiration until I can no longer move forward, I suppose. Regardless of the outcome, those who are loved will have their hearts filled and experience happiness.</p>
<h2 id="on-other-matters">On Other Matters</h2>
<p>In my work journey over the past year, I moved from the trepidation of entering the workforce, through the painful struggle of being thrust into managing a project, to everything gradually falling into place. I gained much learning and growth from work, met a very compatible leader and an interesting project team. Another leader often encourages me on Twitter to consolidate my growth. I&rsquo;m grateful that my first job allowed me to meet them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite emotional to reflect. Although there were many ups and downs, looking back now, most seem trivial. Yet, I neglected truly important aspects of life and emotions because of these. I suppose this is life—it&rsquo;s never possible to view one&rsquo;s every move from God&rsquo;s perspective. But at least I&rsquo;m still doing what I love in the industry I chose to pursue. This is perhaps the greatest fortune.</p>
<p>I began writing blog posts again in earnest. This year, I published 22 blog posts, although half were updated just last month. I filled the gap I had long wanted to write about blog setup, received quite a bit of attention and comments, and met many like-minded friends. Because of these articles, I became an author on &ldquo;<a href="https://sspai.com/u/pseudoyu/posts">Sspai</a>&rdquo;, had an article shared by its founder, and even received invitations for commissioned articles—an interesting experience.</p>
<p>In the new year, I should continue to persist in output.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/yu_blog_update.png" alt="yu_blog_update"></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always wanted to contribute properly to open source, but unexpectedly, it was a GitHub project I published last month, reorganizing my various tools, &ldquo;<a href="https://github.com/pseudoyu/yu-tools">pseudoyu/yu-tools Personal Toolbox</a>&rdquo;, that earned me my first 100 stars—an unexpected joy.</p>
<p><a href="https://star-history.com/#pseudoyu/yu-tools&amp;Date"><img src="https://api.star-history.com/png?repos=pseudoyu/yu-tools&amp;type=Date" alt="Star History Chart"></a></p>
<p>In the coming year, I hope to focus more on input and consolidation, making more code contributions to open source projects.</p>
<p>Perhaps I still carry the soul of an English major. I completed the translation of 8 Go language-related technical articles in the &ldquo;<a href="https://github.com/gocn/translator">GoCN Translation Group</a>&rdquo;, participated in the &ldquo;<a href="https://darkhandbook.io">Blockchain Dark Forest Self-Rescue Manual</a>&rdquo; led by the blockchain security expert Cosine, completing the English version translation and global release. This can be considered a small contribution to the blockchain industry.</p>
<p>Perhaps these are merely insignificant steps on the path of technology, but at least I&rsquo;m moving forward.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This was my 24th year, ordinary yet unforgettable.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/lawrence_comments.png" alt="lawrence_comments"></p>
<p>For the upcoming 25th year, I can&rsquo;t say I have too many expectations. Let me end with a quote from my comment on a video by &ldquo;<a href="https://space.bilibili.com/37029661">Xiao Lu Lawrence</a>&rdquo;:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are times in life when we need to struggle and force ourselves to live on alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m grateful for his comment as my favorite blogger on that post; it was very encouraging. I&rsquo;m also thankful for all the family and friends who care about me. In the new year, please continue to look after me.</p>

<p>It has been five years since I started using macOS, beginning with my first MacBook Pro that I saved up for during the summer of 2017. As my work and study needs have grown, I&rsquo;ve gradually begun to use a multi-screen workflow. Because I constantly need to open many windows, such as IDEs, text editing tools, terminals, IM software, email clients, and so on, it can quickly become disorganized without careful attention. I found myself constantly switching between windows to find the one I needed, which was very inconvenient. Thus began my journey to explore window management solutions.</p>

<p>First, I outlined my window management needs, listing the following core points:</p>
<ol>
<li>Automatically perform intelligent split-screen on the current desktop each time a new window is opened, such as full screen for a single window, half-screen for two windows, and so on</li>
<li>Adjust the split-screen layout or restore the initial layout through shortcuts</li>
<li>Jump between different windows using shortcuts</li>
<li>Move/exchange different window positions using shortcuts</li>
<li>Conveniently perform some operations on the current window through shortcuts, such as full screen, centering, sending to a specific desktop, etc.</li>
<li>Fast switching speed</li>
</ol>
<p>With these requirements in mind, I began to research several popular window management tools currently available.</p>
<h2 id="window-management-tools">Window Management Tools</h2>
<p>There are already many relatively mature window management tool solutions on the market, such as <a href="https://magnet.crowdcafe.com">Magnet</a>, <a href="https://docs.folivora.ai/docs/100_window_snapping_chapter.html">BetterTouchTool&rsquo;s built-in window snapping function</a>, etc. I have purchased and used both, but overall, I felt they didn&rsquo;t quite fit my workflow.</p>
<p>Magnet primarily relies on shortcuts. Although you can customize shortcuts to suit your habits, the memory cost is high. Moreover, if you have multiple devices, you need to download and reconfigure it with your own account to continue using it, which is not convenient.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/magnet_keyshotcuts.png" alt="magnet_keyshotcuts"></p>
<p>BetterTouchTool, on the other hand, relies on moving the mouse to various trigger corners of the window. The advantage is that you don&rsquo;t need to set shortcuts yourself; you only need to move the mouse to the edge of the window to achieve split-screen. However, it shares the same drawback as Magnet: each time you open a new window, you still need to manually implement split-screen, which is often forgotten when you&rsquo;re busy or have many windows open, making it inconvenient to manage.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/bettertouchtool_setting.png" alt="bettertouchtool_setting"></p>
<p>Since existing software couldn&rsquo;t fully meet my needs, as a programmer who loves to tinker, I turned my attention to some highly customizable solutions from the open-source community.</p>
<h2 id="open-source-solutions">Open Source Solutions</h2>
<h3 id="hammerspoon">Hammerspoon</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.hammerspoon.org">Hammerspoon</a> is a powerful macOS automation tool that can implement window management functions by writing some lua scripts, and can customize shortcuts. In addition to window management, it can also implement rich functions such as sleep control and clipboard tools. After configuring and using it for a while, I found that, similar to Magnet, it couldn&rsquo;t effectively implement intelligent split-screen (perhaps there are ready-made scripts, but it&rsquo;s troublesome to configure many applications individually), so I abandoned it as well.</p>
<h3 id="yabai--skhd">yabai + skhd</h3>
<p>After some research, I found a solution from YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/JoshMedeski">Josh Medeski</a>&rsquo;s video &lt;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYsCAOfGjxE">Blazing Fast Window Management on macOS</a>&gt;. It&rsquo;s open-source, free, highly customizable, and only requires one configuration file to perfectly meet all my needs.</p>
<h4 id="yabai">yabai</h4>
<p><a href="https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai">yabai</a> is an open-source extension of macOS&rsquo;s built-in window management tool that allows free control of windows and multiple displays through command-line tools. Its main feature is the use of the <code>binary space partitioning</code> algorithm to automatically modify window layout, allowing us to focus on window content without needing active management. We only need to open the corresponding application window to achieve automatic arrangement, without disrupting our workflow.</p>
<h4 id="skhd">skhd</h4>
<p><a href="https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd">skhd</a> is a macOS shortcut management tool that can call and bind other programs/commands through configuration files, such as yabai&rsquo;s window management commands, to achieve highly customized window operations. skhd&rsquo;s implementation is very performance-focused, with fast response times.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>My configuration is basically only partially modified based on the example provided officially, using the <code>bsp</code> algorithm for intelligent split-screen, and adjusting the space to 15, which is more comfortable spacing.</p>
<p>I also added some custom rules to ignore applications that cannot customize windows when opening system configurations, decompression tools, etc.</p>
<p>The overall presentation is as follows (the following effect is the algorithm automatically arranging after opening application windows, and new windows will be automatically rearranged):</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/my_layout_1.png" alt="my_layout_1"></p>
<h3 id="skhd-1">skhd</h3>
<p>After configuring yabai, we have achieved intelligent split-screen, but sometimes the window positions provided by the algorithm do not meet our needs, or we need to frequently switch/adjust between various windows. That&rsquo;s where we need to use the skhd tool to customize some shortcut configurations.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In simple terms, I configured a setup similar to vim shortcut operation logic, implementing the following common functions:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;Option&gt; + hjkl</code> to focus between different windows</li>
<li><code>&lt;Option&gt; + &lt;Shift&gt; + hjkl</code> to swap different windows</li>
<li><code>&lt;Option&gt; + &lt;Shift&gt; + 0</code> to reset window layout</li>
<li><code>&lt;Option&gt; + &lt;Shift&gt; + &lt;1~9&gt;</code> to quickly move the current window to a specific desktop</li>
<li><code>&lt;Option&gt; + f</code> for full screen</li>
<li><code>&lt;Option&gt; + t</code> to float window to screen center / unfloat window</li>
<li><code>&lt;Option&gt; + g</code> to set/unset window space</li>
<li><code>&lt;Option&gt; + r</code> to rotate window layout</li>
<li><code>&lt;Option&gt; + e</code> to modify window split method</li>
</ul>
<p>Among these, <code>hjkl</code> are commonly used operations in the vim editor. You can also modify them to up, down, left, right, or other keys you prefer.</p>
<p>After completing the above configuration, we have achieved yabai intelligent window management and window operations through simple shortcuts. Next, let&rsquo;s make some configurations to the macOS system to optimize our window management system.</p>
<h3 id="macos-desktop-management">macOS Desktop Management</h3>
<p>macOS provides powerful multi-desktop management functionality. Each desktop area can be understood as a workspace where different windows can be placed independently, as shown in the following image:</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/macos_desktop_management.png" alt="macos_desktop_management"></p>
<p>We can use desktops to distinguish our work areas, such as using Desktop 1 for development IDEs and terminals, Desktop 2 for browser queries and document writing, Desktop 3 for handling WeChat, email, and other communication tools, and Desktop 4 for leisure and entertainment, video playback, etc. This way, we only need to switch between a few desktops to implement our workflow logic without worrying about window focus issues.</p>
<p>To further optimize and switch between desktops more quickly, we can use launchers like <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com">Alfred</a> or <a href="https://www.raycast.com">Raycast</a> to quickly launch/focus applications, or use shortcuts provided by window switching software like <a href="https://alt-tab-macos.netlify.app">AltTab</a> or <a href="https://manico.im">Manico</a> to quickly switch between open applications.</p>
<p>In addition, the macOS system settings also provide customizable switching shortcuts. I modified <code>&lt;Option&gt; + &lt;1~9&gt;</code> to specific desktops, so when I&rsquo;m working, I can quickly get to the corresponding workspace by pressing the corresponding shortcut, which quickly becomes muscle memory.</p>
<p>Open <strong>System Preferences - Keyboard - Shortcuts - Mission Control</strong>, where we can set corresponding shortcuts for different desktops. If they don&rsquo;t show up, you can first open 9 empty desktops to configure, and the configuration will be retained even after closing the desktops.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/keyboardshortcut_to_change_desktop.png" alt="keyboardshortcut_to_change_desktop"></p>
<p>Additionally, there&rsquo;s another small setting I like. Open <strong>System Preferences - Accessibility - Display - Display - Reduce motion</strong>. This will reduce the animation effect when switching between different desktops, increasing switching speed. Combined with our automatic split-screen and shortcuts, this achieves fast and powerful multi-workspace switching. I prioritize speed and efficiency, but if you enjoy macOS animations, you can skip this step.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/reduce_display_effect.png" alt="reduce_display_effect"></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The above is my current macOS window management solution. I&rsquo;m someone who loves to tinker with software and various configurations, often spending several days troubleshooting a small requirement, always pursuing my best practices.</p>
<p>Perhaps many configurations won&rsquo;t save me a lot of time in my subsequent work, with window organization and switching only differing by a few seconds. But when I use the system I once spent a lot of thought researching and optimizing in my daily work and study, or when a sudden need uses a software/configuration I previously tinkered with, I feel inexplicably happy and accomplished. This is probably the meaning of tinkering, and I hope everyone can enjoy such happiness.</p>
<p>I maintain a toolbox project on GitHub 『<a href="https://github.com/pseudoyu/yu-tools">GitHub - pseudoyu/yu-tools</a>』, which records many other software and hardware choices, and is constantly being updated and optimized. If you&rsquo;re interested, feel free to communicate, and I will gradually produce corresponding configuration/usage tutorials.</p>

However, before using these pre-packaged frameworks, we can interact directly with our local Ganache node using Web3.py to better understand the principles and lay a solid foundation for our subsequent use of frameworks.</p>
<p>This article uses Web3.py as an example to implement basic contract compilation, deployment to the local Ganache network, and interaction with contracts.</p>
<p>You can click <a href="https://github.com/pseudoyu/learn-solidity/tree/master/web3_py_simple_storage">here</a> to access the code repository for this test demo.</p>
<h2 id="web3py">Web3.py</h2>
<p>Web3.py is an open-source library for Python that provides a simple API allowing us to interact with the Ethereum network through Python programs. Its GitHub address is <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/web3.py">ethereum/web3.py</a>, and you can visit its <a href="https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">official documentation</a> for usage.</p>
<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>
<p>We can install Web3.py using the Python package management tool pip, as follows:</p>

<p>Debugging smart contracts requires deploying the contract to an actual chain, but deploying to the Ethereum mainnet or testnets like Rinkeby/Koven is not convenient for debugging. Therefore, we need a local blockchain environment, and Ganache provides us with such a local debugging environment. Ganache mainly comes in two installation methods: GUI and CLI.</p>
<h3 id="ganache-gui">Ganache GUI</h3>
<p>In your local environment, such as Mac/Windows systems, we can choose the Ganache client with a graphical interface. The installation and use are very convenient. You can select the corresponding version on the <a href="https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/">Ganache official website</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/ganache_download.png" alt="ganache_download"></p>
<p>After installation, selecting Quick Start will quickly launch a locally running blockchain network and initialize ten accounts with 100 ETH each, which can be used during development and debugging.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/ganache_account.png" alt="ganache_account"></p>
<h3 id="ganache-cli-installation">Ganache CLI Installation</h3>
<p>If your system doesn&rsquo;t support GUI installation, we can use CLI installation. The installation method is as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">npm install --global yarn
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">yarn global add ganache-cli
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/ganache_cli_install.png" alt="ganache_cli_install"></p>
<p>After waiting for it to complete installation, you can start the local test network. Consistent with Ganache GUI, it also includes initialized accounts and balances.</p>

<p>The above are the steps for interacting with the local Ganache test network using the Web3.py library. In actual production project development, we generally don&rsquo;t directly use libraries like Web3.py, but instead use further encapsulated libraries like Brownie and HardHat. However, understanding how to use libraries like Web3.py or Web3.js is also very important.</p>

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>In a previous article, &ldquo;Free Personal Blog System Setup and Deployment Solution (Hugo + GitHub Pages + Cusdis)&rdquo;, I mentioned using Hugo, a static site generator, to truly build my personal blog. I made some personal customizations and configurations based on the hugo-theme-den theme from the Hugo open-source community to meet my needs.</p>
<p>My solution primarily consists of the following core components:</p>
<ol>
<li>Personal blog source repository for version control of blog configurations and all article .md source files, coupled with GitHub Action for automated deployment, automatically generating static sites and pushing them to the GitHub Pages blog publishing repository.</li>
<li>(Optional) GitHub Pages blog publishing repository, named in the form of username.github.io, using GitHub Pages for website deployment, which can use custom domain names through CNAME resolution configuration.</li>
<li>(Optional) Cloudflare account and Cloudflare Pages project.</li>
<li>Hugo theme repository, fork your favorite theme, and version control your personal customization and configuration, linked to the personal blog source repository via git submodule.</li>
<li>Other component source repositories, such as umami website data statistics and Cusdis website comment system, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>The following text will provide a detailed explanation of the setup, local testing, automated deployment, and maintenance processes, which I hope will be helpful to everyone.</p>
<h2 id="building-a-blog-with-hugo">Building a Blog with Hugo</h2>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/hugo_website.png" alt="hugo_website"></p>
<p>Hugo is a blogging tool implemented in Go that uses Markdown for article editing, automatically generates static site files, supports rich theme configurations, and can also embed plugins like comment systems through JavaScript, offering high customization. Besides Hugo, there are other choices like Gatsby, Jekyll, Hexo, Ghost, etc., which are similar in implementation and usage. You can choose according to your preference.</p>
<h3 id="installing-hugo">Installing Hugo</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m using macOS, so I use the official recommended homebrew method to install the Hugo program. The process is similar for other systems.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">brew install hugo
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>After completion, use the following command to verify:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">hugo version
</span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id="creating-a-hugo-website">Creating a Hugo Website</h3>
<p>After installing the Hugo program using the above command, you can create, configure, and locally debug the website using the hugo new site command.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">hugo new site blog-test
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/hugo_new_site.png" alt="hugo_new_site"></p>
<h3 id="configuring-the-theme">Configuring the Theme</h3>
<p>After creating our site using the above command, we need to configure the theme. The Hugo community has a rich selection of themes, which you can choose from the official website&rsquo;s Themes menu based on your preferred style and preview effects. After selection, you can enter the theme project repository, which usually has detailed installation and configuration instructions. Below, I&rsquo;ll demonstrate the configuration process using the hugo-theme-den theme I&rsquo;m currently using as an example.</p>
<h4 id="linking-the-theme-repository">Linking the Theme Repository</h4>
<p>We can directly git clone the theme repository for use, but this method has some drawbacks. When you later modify the theme, it may conflict with the original theme, making version management and subsequent updates inconvenient. I chose to fork the original theme repository to my own account and use git submodule to link the repository. This way, I can maintain the theme modifications separately in the future.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nb">cd</span> blog-test/
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">git init

</span></span></code></pre></div><p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/hugo_init_theme.png" alt="hugo_init_theme"></p>
<h4 id="updating-the-theme">Updating the Theme</h4>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve cloned someone else&rsquo;s blog project for modification, you need to use the following command to initialize:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">git submodule update --init --recursive
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If you need to synchronize the latest modifications from the theme repository, run the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">git submodule update --remote
</span></span></code></pre></div><h4 id="initializing-theme-configuration-and-publishing">Initializing Theme Configuration and Publishing</h4>
<p>Each theme usually provides some sample configurations and initial pages. When starting to use a theme, you can copy the files from its exampleSite/ directory to the site directory and adjust the configuration based on that.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">cp -rf themes/hugo-theme-den/exampleSite/* ./
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>After initializing the basic theme configuration, we can configure site details in the config.toml file. Refer to the theme&rsquo;s documentation for specific configuration items.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/hugo_theme_config.png" alt="hugo_theme_config"></p>
<p>After completion, you can publish new articles using the hugo new command.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">hugo new posts/blog-test.md
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/hugo_new_post.png" alt="hugo_new_post"></p>
<h4 id="local-site-debugging">Local Site Debugging</h4>
<p>Hugo generates static web pages. When editing and debugging locally, we can use the hugo server command for real-time local preview debugging without needing to regenerate each time.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">hugo server
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/hugo_server.png" alt="hugo_server"></p>
<p>After running the service, we can access our local preview webpage through the browser at http://localhost:1313.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/hugo_server_preview.png" alt="hugo_server_preview"></p>
<h3 id="purchasing-a-domain-name">Purchasing a Domain Name</h3>
<p>As an externally published website, we need to purchase a domain name and configure its resolution to point to the server where our website is located, allowing the outside world to access it conveniently. There are many domain name purchasing platforms; I&rsquo;ve used Cloudflare, NameSilo, GoDaddy, etc. I ultimately prefer Cloudflare because it also provides powerful features like CDN, website data analysis, and custom rules.</p>
<p>First, we need to register a Cloudflare account. After logging in, select &ldquo;Register Domain&rdquo; from the left sidebar and search for the domain you want to register.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/cloudflare_register_domain.png" alt="cloudflare_register_domain"></p>
<p>After selecting your desired domain, click and choose the purchase duration and fill in your personal information.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/cloudflare_register_domain_choose.png" alt="cloudflare_register_domain_choose"></p>
<p>Choose a payment method; it&rsquo;s recommended to select automatic renewal to avoid forgetting to renew.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/cloudflare_register_domain_payment.png" alt="cloudflare_register_domain_payment"></p>
<p>Select Personal for the type and click to complete the purchase.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/cloudflare_register_done.png" alt="cloudflare_register_done"></p>
<p>Wait for Cloudflare to process, and then you can view the information.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/cloudflare_domain.jpg" alt="cloudflare_domain"></p>
<h3 id="publishing-blog-with-cloudflare-pages-recommended">Publishing Blog with Cloudflare Pages (Recommended)</h3>
<p><strong>[Updated 2024-06-30]</strong></p>
<h4 id="introduction-to-cloudflare-pages">Introduction to Cloudflare Pages</h4>
<p>GitHub Pages is already a free and powerful static website hosting platform that seamlessly integrates with GitHub code repositories. However, its access speed in China is not ideal. Since my domain is already hosted on Cloudflare, I tried Cloudflare Pages, which is a static website hosting service launched by Cloudflare. It&rsquo;s completely free (at least I haven&rsquo;t exceeded the free quota so far) and can directly connect to GitHub code repositories, achieving the same automated deployment functionality as GitHub Pages while providing better access routes. It&rsquo;s currently a better solution.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/cloudflare_pages_create.png" alt="cloudflare_pages_create"></p>
<h4 id="creating-a-cloudflare-pages-project">Creating a Cloudflare Pages Project</h4>
<p>First, we need to register a Cloudflare account, then select the &ldquo;Workers &amp; Pages&rdquo; menu on the left and click to create a project.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/cloudflare_pages_with_git.png" alt="cloudflare_pages_with_git"></p>
<p>The next step offers two options: directly uploading static files or connecting to git. The first option is usually suitable for single-page or very low-frequency update projects that don&rsquo;t need GitHub code hosting, such as single HTML page websites. Connecting to git allows for better automatic building of new web pages for each blog submission, which is the method we&rsquo;ll use.</p>
<h4 id="building-with-hugo">Building with Hugo</h4>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/yu_blog_test_build_hugo_cloudflare_pages.png" alt="yu_blog_test_build_hugo_cloudflare_pages"></p>
<p>Since Cloudflare Pages provides almost all common website building tools on the market, such as Next.js, Astro, Hugo, etc., we can choose from two methods for deployment:</p>
<ol>
<li>Directly use the building tools provided by Cloudflare Pages to generate static web pages and deploy them online based on the repository code.</li>
<li>Generate a static web page repository or branch similar to the GitHub Pages method mentioned above, and deploy it online directly through Cloudflare Pages.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/cloudflare_build_site_hugo_in_progress.png" alt="cloudflare_build_site_hugo_in_progress"></p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/cloudflare_pages_build_done.png" alt="cloudflare_pages_build_done"></p>
<p>The first method can greatly simplify our deployment process. All we need to do is link the blog source repository we created above (such as my repository pseudoyu/yu-blog). Each submission will automatically build and deploy, only requiring a wait of a few tens of seconds to complete, without the need to write various GitHub Actions build commands like with GitHub Pages. It&rsquo;s very convenient and the most recommended method.</p>
<p>The second method is actually similar to the GitHub Pages approach and is more suitable for websites with special requirements for the build process. For example, when building my personal blog website, I simultaneously execute some Python in GitHub Actions to automatically update my About page. These complex operations cannot be directly handled by the building tools provided by Cloudflare Pages, so I chose the second method.</p>
<p>You can directly use the following simplified GitHub Actions in your blog source repository:</p>

<ul>
<li>push: Execute GitHub Action after a push action occurs in this project repository</li>
<li>workflow_dispatch: Can be manually called from the Action toolbar in the GitHub project repository</li>
<li>schedule: Execute GitHub Action on a schedule, such as my setting to execute every morning Beijing time, mainly to use some automated statistical CI to automatically update my blog&rsquo;s about page, such as this week&rsquo;s coding time, audio and video records, etc. If you don&rsquo;t need the timing feature, you can delete this condition</li>
</ul>
<p>jobs represents the tasks in GitHub Action. We set up a build task, runs-on indicates the GitHub Action running environment, we chose ubuntu-latest. Our build task includes four main steps: Checkout, Setup Hugo, Build Web, and Deploy Web, where run is the command to execute, and uses is a plugin in GitHub Action. We used the peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2 and peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3 plugins. In the Checkout step, setting submodules to true in with can synchronize the submodules of the blog source repository, which is our theme module.</p>
<p>The above GitHub Actions will push the static files generated by the blog to the cf-pages branch, because we choose this branch for deployment in Cloudflare Pages. If we need to add some additional steps, we can add some custom steps before the build, which is very flexible. For specific applications, you can see the &ldquo;GitHub - yu-blog/.github/workflows/deploy.yml&rdquo; example.</p>

<p>If it&rsquo;s a domain registered/hosted in Cloudflare, you can directly select &ldquo;Activate Domain&rdquo;, which will automatically add DNS resolution. If it&rsquo;s a domain from another platform, manually add CNAME resolution.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/custom_domain_wait_dns.png" alt="custom_domain_wait_dns"></p>
<p>After configuring DNS, just wait for it to take effect.</p>
<h3 id="publishing-blog-with-github-pages">Publishing Blog with GitHub Pages</h3>
<h4 id="creating-a-repository">Creating a Repository</h4>
<p>The GitHub Pages project needs to follow the special naming format of username.github.io. After establishing the repository, you can configure your registered custom domain in the settings to point to the URL generated by GitHub Pages. Additionally, you need to change the baseURL in the blog site configuration file config.toml to your custom domain, in the format of &ldquo;<a href="https://www.pseudoyu.com/%22">https://www.pseudoyu.com/&quot;</a>. This allows the blog site to properly access the website service generated by GitHub Pages.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/github_pages_repo.png" alt="github_pages_repo"></p>
<h4 id="domain-resolution">Domain Resolution</h4>
<p>After registering according to the steps above, you need to set up DNS resolution with your domain hosting provider. Here, we need to choose CNAME, pointing to our GitHub Pages URL.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/cloudflare_cname_config.png" alt="cloudflare_cname_config"></p>
<p>Because CNAME resolution can&rsquo;t set the root domain, meaning you can only set <a href="https://www.pseudoyu.com">www.pseudoyu.com</a> or other subdomains, not pseudoyu.com, we can use Cloudflare&rsquo;s custom rules to set domain redirection. The specific configuration is as follows, just replace my domain with your own. Even if you registered your domain through NameSilo, you can add a site through Cloudflare to implement this functionality, or other hosting platforms have similar features, just follow their instructions to configure.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/cloudflare_cname_rule_config.png" alt="cloudflare_cname_rule_config"></p>
<p>After completing the above preparations, we can now access our GitHub Pages through our custom domain. Currently, because the project repository is empty, visiting will show a 404 page.</p>
<p>We want the static website generated by Hugo to be hosted through the GitHub Pages service, without having to maintain the service ourselves, which is more stable and secure. Therefore, we need to upload the static web page files generated by Hugo to the GitHub Pages project repository.</p>
<h4 id="manual-publishing">Manual Publishing</h4>
<p>After editing blog content and debugging locally through hugo server, we can generate static web page files using the hugo command.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">hugo
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nb">cd</span> public/
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/hugo_gen_pages.png" alt="hugo_gen_pages"></p>
<p>Hugo by default stores generated static web page files in the public/ directory. We can initialize the public/ directory as a git repository and associate it with our pseudoyu/pseudoyu.github.io remote repository to push our web page static files.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">git init
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">git remote add origin git@github.com:pseudoyu/pseudoyu.github.io
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">git add .
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">git commit -m <span class="s2">&#34;add test&#34;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/hugo_public_init.png" alt="hugo_public_init"></p>
<p>After checking the file modifications, you can push to the GitHub Pages repository using git push origin master. Wait a few minutes, and you can access our blog site through our custom domain, completely consistent with our local hugo server debugging.</p>
<h4 id="automated-publishing">Automated Publishing</h4>
<p>Through the above commands, we can manually publish our static files, but there are still some drawbacks:</p>
<ol>
<li>The publishing steps are still cumbersome, requiring switching to the public/ directory for uploading after local debugging.</li>
<li>Unable to backup and version control the blog .md source files.</li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore, we need a simple and smooth way to publish the blog. First, let&rsquo;s initialize the repository for the blog source files, such as my repository pseudoyu/yu-blog.</p>
<p>Because our blog is based on GitHub and GitHub Pages, we can use the official GitHub Action for CI automatic publishing. I&rsquo;ll explain this in detail below. GitHub Action is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that can be used to automate build, test, and deployment pipelines. Currently, many workflows have been developed, which can be directly used with simple configuration.</p>
<p>The configuration is located in the repository directory .github/workflows, with a .yml suffix. My GitHub Action configuration is pseudoyu/yu-blog deploy.yml, and an example configuration for automatic publishing is as follows:</p>

</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>First, you need to change the EXTERNAL_REPOSITORY in the above deploy.yml to your own GitHub Pages repository, such as my setting pseudoyu/pseudoyu.github.io.</p>
<p>Because we need to push from the blog repository to an external GitHub Pages repository, specific permissions are required. You need to create a Token under GitHub account&rsquo;s Setting - Developer setting - Personal access tokens.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/github_psersonal_access_token.png" alt="github_psersonal_access_token"></p>
<p>The permissions need to enable repo and workflow.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/yu_blog_personal_token.png" alt="yu_blog_personal_token"></p>
<p>After configuration, copy the generated Token (Note: it will only appear once), then add the PERSONAL_TOKEN environment variable as the Token we just created in the Settings - Secrets - Actions of our blog source repository. This way, GitHub Action can access the Token.</p>
<p>After completing the above configuration, push the code to the repository, which will trigger GitHub Action, automatically generating blog pages and pushing them to the GitHub Pages repository.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/yu_blog_ci.png" alt="yu_blog_ci"></p>
<p>When the GitHub Pages repository is updated, it will automatically trigger the official page deployment CI, achieving our website publication.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/page_build_ci.png" alt="page_build_ci"></p>
<p>After the above configuration, we have achieved local Hugo blog setup and version control, GitHub Pages website deployment and publishing, Hugo theme management and updates, and other functions, implementing a complete system. Now, whenever we finish editing blog content locally using familiar Markdown syntax, we only need to push the code and wait a few minutes to access the updated website through our custom domain.</p>
<h3 id="component-extensions">Component Extensions</h3>
<p>A complete blog system also requires some components, such as website data statistics and comment systems. I have written comprehensive Serverless setup tutorials for these two core needs, which you can deploy and configure according to your requirements.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The above is the free blog automatic deployment system I implemented using Hugo and GitHub Action. My implementation repository is in the pseudoyu/yu-blog repository, and my customized theme repository is in pseudoyu/hugo-theme-den.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also implemented many interesting automated personal statistics functions using GitHub Action, automatically updating my GitHub Profile. The project repository is pseudoyu/pseudoyu. You can explore .github/workflows on your own. These systems are continuously being improved, and I welcome everyone to contribute and exchange ideas.</p>

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>I am an advocate of static blogs and serverless support. My <a href="https://www.pseudoyu.com">personal blog</a> and some <a href="https://www.pseudoyu.com/blockchain-guide">knowledge base projects</a> are generated using <a href="https://gohugo.io">hugo</a> and hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a>. This approach is convenient for version control and deployment maintenance, but for non-technical individuals, using command-line git operations can be overly complex, and it&rsquo;s not particularly convenient for scenarios involving multiple collaborators.</p>
<p>Last week, a former colleague (non-technical) asked me to help set up a portal website, mainly to showcase company information and publish news, features, tools, etc. Considering ease of use and other factors, and having just seen the official release of <a href="https://ghost.org">Ghost</a> version 5.0, which supports many powerful features such as email subscriptions and data analysis, and can be self-hosted, I considered this solution. The following text records the installation and deployment process.</p>
<h2 id="ghost-50">Ghost 5.0</h2>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/ghost_5_intro.jpg" alt="ghost_5_intro"></p>
<p>Ghost is a rather old-school blogging tool that has been developing and improving for 9 years since its prototype was released in 2013. The recently launched version 5.0 is very suitable for individuals and independent publishing platforms. The 5.0 version includes the following feature updates:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for more powerful subscription functions, such as tiered subscriptions</li>
<li>Support for multiple email subscriptions, making design modifications more convenient</li>
<li>Support for publishing promotional activities, with a more powerful user analysis dashboard</li>
<li>Native support for videos, blogs, GIFs, e-commerce products, NFTs, etc.</li>
<li>Release of more new themes</li>
<li>Performance optimization of 20%+</li>
<li>&hellip;</li>
</ul>
<p>Ghost officially supports various deployment methods, such as Ghost(Pro) hosting, Docker images, server installation, etc. However, because Ghost&rsquo;s production environment depends on Ubuntu, Node, MySQL, and other environments, it can be quite troublesome to set up independently, and the maintenance cost is also relatively high. After some research, according to the installation instructions in the official documentation, Digital Ocean is Ghost&rsquo;s official cloud hosting partner, providing a one-click deployment and installation method, which is simple and convenient.</p>
<h2 id="installation-and-deployment-instructions">Installation and Deployment Instructions</h2>
<h3 id="domain-purchase">Domain Purchase</h3>
<p>As a publicly accessible website, we need to purchase a domain name and configure DNS resolution to point to the server where our website is located, allowing the public to access it conveniently. There are many domain purchase platforms; I have used <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com">Cloudflare</a>, <a href="https://www.namesilo.com">NameSilo</a>, <a href="https://www.godaddy.com">GoDaddy</a>, etc. I ended up regularly using Cloudflare because it also provides powerful features such as CDN, website data analysis, and custom rules.</p>
<p>First, we need to register a Cloudflare account. After completing and logging in, select &ldquo;Register Domain&rdquo; from the left sidebar and search for the domain name you want to register.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/cloudflare_register_domain.png" alt="cloudflare_register_domain"></p>
<p>After selecting your desired domain name, click and choose the purchase duration and fill in your personal information.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/cloudflare_register_domain_choose.png" alt="cloudflare_register_domain_choose"></p>
<p>Choose the payment method. It&rsquo;s advisable to select auto-renewal to avoid forgetting to renew.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/cloudflare_register_domain_payment.png" alt="cloudflare_register_domain_payment"></p>
<p>Select &lsquo;Personal&rsquo; for the type and click to complete the purchase.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/cloudflare_register_done.png" alt="cloudflare_register_done"></p>
<p>Wait for Cloudflare to process, and then you can view the information.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/cloudflare_domain.jpg" alt="cloudflare_domain"></p>
<h3 id="digital-ocean-ssh-configuration">Digital Ocean SSH Configuration</h3>
<p>As we will need to access the Digital Ocean host later, we first need to register an account and configure our SSH key for password-free login.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/digital_ocean_add_key.png" alt="digital_ocean_add_key"></p>
<p>Enter our SSH key and click add.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/digital_ocean_ssh_config.png" alt="digital_ocean_ssh_config"></p>
<h3 id="one-click-creation-of-ghost-droplet">One-Click Creation of Ghost Droplet</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, Ghost provides support for one-click Droplet creation on Digital Ocean. We can visit the <a href="https://ghost.org/docs/install/">installation instructions document</a> and click on the Digital Ocean icon to jump.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/ghost_use_digital_ocean.png" alt="ghost_use_digital_ocean"></p>
<p>We can also search and select in the Digital Ocean image marketplace, then click Create in the upper right corner.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/digital_ocean_market_ghost.png" alt="digital_ocean_market_ghost"></p>
<p>According to the official instructions, the $5/month plan configuration is already sufficient. You can also expand with one click if you have higher requirements later (Note: If you choose a high configuration first, you cannot downgrade).</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/digital_ocean_ghost_config.png" alt="digital_ocean_ghost_config"></p>
<p>Choose the host instance region. I chose the US region, but you can choose according to your needs. Also, select the SSH configuration we added earlier for convenient access later.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/digital_ocean_ghost_region.png" alt="digital_ocean_ghost_region"></p>
<p>After completing the configuration selection, we choose the quantity, name, and click Create Droplet.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/digital_ocean_ghost_create.png" alt="digital_ocean_ghost_create"></p>
<p>Wait for Digital Ocean to prepare the host, which takes about a few minutes to complete.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/digital_ocean_ghost_done_hide.jpg" alt="digital_ocean_ghost_done_hide"></p>
<h3 id="configure-domain-name-resolution">Configure Domain Name Resolution</h3>
<p>Because Ghost needs to configure HTTPS, and for the convenience of users to access, we need to set up DNS resolution for the newly created server.</p>
<p>Log in to Cloudflare, select the domain we just registered, select the DNS tab on the left, and configure A record resolution (generally need to configure root resolution and www resolution). The operation is similar for other domain hosting websites.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/cloudflare_dns_config.jpg" alt="cloudflare_dns_config"></p>
<h3 id="domain-ssltls-configuration-optional">Domain SSL/TLS Configuration (Optional)</h3>
<p>If using Cloudflare for hosting, you can choose to configure the SSL/TLS encryption mode to Full for enhanced security.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/cloudflare_ssl_config.png" alt="cloudflare_ssl_config"></p>
<h3 id="one-click-installation-of-ghost-service">One-Click Installation of Ghost Service</h3>
<p>After completing the domain resolution, we can connect to the host through the Digital Ocean console or other terminal tools to perform one-click installation.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/ghost_one_key_install.jpg" alt="ghost_one_key_install"></p>
<p>After pressing Enter, the script will automatically start installing the service and various dependencies.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/ghost_start_install.png" alt="ghost_start_install"></p>
<p>The installation is command-line interactive. We only need to input two custom configurations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enter your blog URL</li>
<li>Enter your email (For SSL Certificate)</li>
</ul>
<p>Enter your domain name and email at these two points, then wait for the installation to complete.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/ghost_install_config.jpg" alt="ghost_install_config"></p>
<h3 id="accessing-the-website">Accessing the Website</h3>
<p>After the script execution is complete, we can access the Ghost website.</p>
<ul>
<li>https://<code>{your domain}</code>/ghost, admin interface</li>
<li>https://<code>{your domain}</code>, website address</li>

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>Last year, during my graduate studies, I took the course &ldquo;COMP7408 Distributed Ledger and Blockchain Technology&rdquo; at HKU. In this course, I learned about Ethereum smart contract development and created a simple library management ÐApp. For my graduation project, I chose to develop a music copyright application based on Ethereum, which can be found at <a href="https://github.com/pseudoyu/uright">Uright - Blockchain Music Copyright Management ÐApp</a>. Through these experiences, I gained a basic understanding of Solidity development.</p>
<p>After starting my career, I primarily focused on consortium blockchain and business development, and hadn&rsquo;t worked with contracts for a long time. As a result, my grasp of syntax and some underlying concepts became somewhat hazy. Recently, I&rsquo;ve been involved in a project based on an EVM-compatible chain, which involves developing basic contracts for evidence storage, retrieval, and migration. Debugging these contracts has proven challenging, so I decided to undertake a systematic study of Solidity. By organizing my notes into articles, I hope to encourage myself to think deeply and summarize effectively.</p>
<p>This series of articles will also be included in my personal knowledge base project, &ldquo;Blockchain Beginner&rsquo;s Guide,&rdquo; which can be found at <a href="https://www.pseudoyu.com/blockchain-guide/">https://www.pseudoyu.com/blockchain-guide/</a>. I aim to continuously improve this resource as I learn. For those interested, you can visit the <a href="https://github.com/pseudoyu/blockchain-guide">project repository</a> to contribute or offer suggestions.</p>
<p>This article is the first in the series and will cover the fundamental knowledge of Solidity.</p>
<h2 id="smart-contracts-and-the-solidity-language">Smart Contracts and the Solidity Language</h2>
<p>Smart contracts are programs that run on the blockchain. Contract developers can use smart contracts to interact with on-chain assets and data, while users can call contracts through their on-chain accounts to access assets and data. Due to the blockchain&rsquo;s characteristics of maintaining historical records in a chain structure, decentralization, and immutability, smart contracts offer greater fairness and transparency compared to traditional applications.</p>
<p>However, since smart contracts need to interact with the blockchain, operations such as deployment and data writing consume a certain amount of fees. The cost of data storage and modification is also relatively high. Therefore, when designing contracts, it&rsquo;s crucial to consider resource consumption. Additionally, once deployed, regular smart contracts cannot be modified, so contract design must take into account security, upgradability, and extensibility.</p>
<p>Solidity is a contract-oriented high-level programming language created for implementing smart contracts. It runs on the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) and has a syntax similar to JavaScript. It is currently the most popular smart contract language and is essential for those entering the blockchain and Web3 fields. Solidity provides relatively comprehensive solutions to address the aforementioned contract writing issues, which we will discuss in detail later.</p>
<h2 id="development-and-debugging-tools">Development and Debugging Tools</h2>
<p>Unlike conventional programming languages, Solidity smart contract development often cannot be conveniently debugged directly through an IDE or local environment. Instead, it requires interaction with an on-chain node. Development and debugging are typically not performed directly on the mainnet (the chain where real assets, data, and business reside), as this would incur high transaction fees. Currently, there are several main methods and frameworks for development and debugging:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle">Truffle</a>. Truffle is a very popular JavaScript framework for Solidity contract development. It provides a complete toolchain for development, testing, and debugging, and can interact with local or remote networks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/eth-brownie/brownie">Brownie</a>. Brownie is a Python-based framework for Solidity contract development. It provides convenient toolchains for debugging and testing with concise Python syntax.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat">Hardhat</a>. Hardhat is another JavaScript-based development framework that offers a very rich plugin system, suitable for developing complex contract projects.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to development frameworks, to better work with Solidity, it&rsquo;s necessary to be familiar with some tools:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a href="https://remix.ethereum.org">Remix IDE</a>. Debugging can be done using the browser-based Remix development tool provided by Ethereum. Remix offers a complete IDE, compilation tools, deployment debugging test node environment, accounts, etc., making it very convenient for testing. This is the tool I used most when learning. Remix can also interact directly with testnets and mainnets through the MetaMask plugin, and some production environments also use it for compilation and deployment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remix IDE is not perfect for syntax suggestions, so you can use <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">Visual Studio Code</a> with the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=juanblanco.solidity">Solidity</a> extension for better writing experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://metamask.io">MetaMask</a>. A commonly used wallet application. During development, you can interact with testnets and mainnets through the browser plugin, which is convenient for developers to debug.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/">Ganache</a>. Ganache is an open-source virtual local node that provides a virtual chain network. It can interact with various Web3.js, Remix, or some framework tools, suitable for local debugging and testing of projects of a certain scale.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://infura.io">Infura</a>. Infura is an IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) product. We can apply for our own Ethereum node and interact through the API provided by Infura, which is convenient for debugging and closer to the production environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.openzeppelin.com">OpenZeppelin</a>. OpenZeppelin provides numerous contract development libraries and applications that ensure security and stability while giving developers a better development experience and reducing contract development costs.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="contract-compilation-and-deployment">Contract Compilation and Deployment</h2>
<p>Solidity contracts are files with the <code>.sol</code> extension and cannot be executed directly. They need to be compiled into bytecode recognizable by the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) to run on the chain.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/compile_solidity.png" alt="compile_solidity"></p>
<p>After compilation, the contract is deployed to the chain by the contract account. Other accounts can interact with the contract through wallets to implement on-chain business logic.</p>
<h2 id="core-syntax">Core Syntax</h2>
<p>Now that we have a basic understanding of Solidity development, debugging, and deployment, let&rsquo;s dive into the core syntax of Solidity.</p>
<h3 id="data-types">Data Types</h3>
<p>Like common programming languages, Solidity has several built-in data types.</p>
<h4 id="basic-data-types">Basic Data Types</h4>
<ul>
<li><code>boolean</code>: Boolean type has two values, <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>. It can be defined as <code>bool public boo = true;</code>. The default value is <code>false</code>.</li>
<li><code>int</code>: Integer type, can be specified from <code>int8</code> to <code>int256</code>, default is <code>int256</code>. It can be defined as <code>int public int = 0;</code>. The default value is <code>0</code>. You can also use <code>type(int).min</code> and <code>type(int).max</code> to check the minimum and maximum values of the type.</li>
<li><code>uint</code>: Non-negative integer type, can be specified as <code>uint8</code>, <code>uint16</code>, <code>uint256</code>, default is <code>uint256</code>. It can be defined as <code>uint8 public u8 = 1;</code>. The default value is <code>0</code>.</li>
<li><code>address</code>: Address type, can be defined as <code>address public addr = 0xCA35b7d915458EF540aDe6068dFe2F44E8fa733c;</code>. The default value is <code>0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000</code>.</li>
<li><code>bytes</code>: Abbreviation of <code>byte[]</code>, divided into fixed-size arrays and variable arrays. It can be defined as <code>bytes1 a = 0xb5;</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also some relatively complex data types, which we will discuss separately.</p>
<h4 id="enum">Enum</h4>
<p><code>Enum</code> is an enumeration type that can be defined using the following syntax:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-solidity" data-lang="solidity"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="kd">enum</span> <span class="nc">Status</span> <span class="p">{</span>

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    <span class="n">Pause</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>It can be updated and initialized using the following syntax:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-solidity" data-lang="solidity"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c1">// Instantiate enum type
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c1"></span><span class="n">Status</span> <span class="k">public</span> <span class="n">status</span><span class="p">;</span>

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    <span class="k">delete</span> <span class="n">status</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><h4 id="arrays">Arrays</h4>
<p>Arrays are ordered collections of elements of the same type. They can be defined as <code>uint[] public arr;</code>. You can specify the array size in advance when defining, such as <code>uint[10] public myFixedSizeArr;</code>.</p>
<p>Note that we can create arrays in memory (the differences between <code>memory</code> and <code>storage</code> will be discussed in detail later), but they must be of fixed size, such as <code>uint[] memory a = new uint[](5);</code>.</p>
<p>Array types have some basic operation methods, as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-solidity" data-lang="solidity"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c1">// Define array type

</span></span></code></pre></div><h4 id="mapping">Mapping</h4>
<p><code>mapping</code> is a mapping type, defined using <code>mapping(keyType =&gt; valueType)</code>, where the key needs to be a built-in type such as <code>bytes</code>, <code>int</code>, <code>string</code>, or contract type, while the value can be any type, such as nested <code>mapping</code> type. Note that <code>mapping</code> types cannot be iterated over; if iteration is needed, you need to implement the corresponding index yourself.</p>
<p>Here are some operations:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id="variables-constants-and-immutable">Variables, Constants, and <code>Immutable</code></h3>
<p>Variables are data structures in Solidity whose values can change. There are three types:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>local</code> variables</li>
<li><code>state</code> variables</li>
<li><code>global</code> variables</li>
</ul>
<p><code>local</code> variables are defined within methods and are not stored on the chain, such as <code>string var = &quot;Hello&quot;;</code>. <code>state</code> variables are defined outside of methods and are stored on the chain. They are defined as <code>string public var;</code>. Writing a value sends a transaction, while reading a value does not. <code>global</code> variables are global variables that provide chain information, such as the current block timestamp variable <code>uint timestamp = block.timestamp;</code>, and the contract caller address variable <code>address sender = msg.sender;</code>.</p>
<p>Variables can be declared using different keywords to indicate different storage locations.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>storage</code>: Stored on the chain</li>
<li><code>memory</code>: In memory, only exists when the method is called</li>
<li><code>calldata</code>: Exists when passed as a parameter to call a method</li>
</ul>
<p>Constants are variables whose values cannot be changed. Using constants can save gas fees. We can define them using <code>string public constant MY_CONSTANT = &quot;0707&quot;;</code>. <code>immutable</code> is a special type whose value can be initialized in the <code>constructor</code> but cannot be changed again. Flexible use of these types can effectively save gas fees and ensure data security.</p>
<h3 id="functions">Functions</h3>
<p>In Solidity, functions are used to define specific business logic.</p>
<h4 id="permission-declaration">Permission Declaration</h4>
<p>Functions have different visibilities, declared using different keywords:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>public</code>: Can be called by any contract</li>
<li><code>private</code>: Can only be called within the contract that defined the method</li>
<li><code>internal</code>: Can only be called in inherited contracts</li>
<li><code>external</code>: Can only be called by other contracts and accounts</li>
</ul>
<p>Contract functions that query data also have different declaration methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>view</code> can read variables but cannot modify them</li>
<li><code>pure</code> cannot read or modify variables</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="function-modifiers">Function Modifiers</h4>

<p>In complex business scenarios, we often need multiple contracts to work together. In this case, we can use the <code>import</code> keyword to import contracts. There are two ways: local import <code>import &quot;./Foo.sol&quot;;</code> and external import <code>import &quot;https://github.com/owner/repo/blob/branch/path/to/Contract.sol&quot;;</code>.</p>
<p>External libraries are similar to contracts but cannot declare state variables and cannot send assets. If all methods of the library are <code>internal</code>, they will be embedded in the contract. If they are not <code>internal</code>, the library needs to be deployed in advance and linked.</p>

<p>The event mechanism is a very important design in contracts. Events allow information to be recorded on the blockchain, and applications like DApps can implement business logic by listening to event data, with very low storage costs. Here&rsquo;s a simple log emission mechanism:</p>

<h3 id="error-handling">Error Handling</h3>

<p>Executing transactions in EVM requires gas fees. <code>gas spent</code> indicates how much gas quantity is needed, <code>gas price</code> is the unit price of gas, <code>Ether</code> and <code>Wei</code> are price units, 1 ether == 1e18 wei.</p>
<p>Contracts will limit Gas. <code>gas limit</code> is set by the user initiating the transaction, indicating the maximum amount of gas to be spent. <code>block gas limit</code> is determined by the blockchain network, indicating the maximum amount of gas allowed in this block.</p>
<p>In contract development, we should particularly consider saving gas fees as much as possible. Here are some common techniques:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use <code>calldata</code> instead of <code>memory</code></li>
<li>Load state variables into memory</li>
<li>Use <code>i++</code> instead of <code>++i</code></li>
<li>Cache array elements</li>

<p>Previously, I wrote an article titled &ldquo;Free Personal Blog System Setup and Deployment Solution (Hugo + GitHub Pages + Cusdis),&rdquo; detailing my blog system built using Serverless and some open-source projects. I also started a series to document the setup process.</p>
<p>This article focuses on the blog comment system solution. The earliest comment system I used was the <del>notorious</del> <a href="https://disqus.com">Disqus</a>, a cumbersome system known for collecting user privacy data. Due to its slow loading and frequent advertisements in the free version, it became unbearable. So, I switched to another comment system based on GitHub issues called <a href="https://utteranc.es">utterances</a>. It generates an issue for each article and allows users to comment on the issue by authorizing GitHub login. The advantage of this method is that it only requires authorizing a <a href="https://github.com/utterances-bot">utterances-bot</a> for management, without the need for self-deployment of services or database maintenance. However, after using it for a while, I found several shortcomings:</p>
<ol>
<li>It relies on the GitHub API for comment management. If there are future API changes or restrictions on using issues for comments, it may become unstable.</li>
<li>Readers must authorize GitHub login, which is inconvenient for non-technical users or those reading on mobile devices.</li>
<li>It clutters the GitHub repository and makes it difficult to migrate to other systems in the future.</li>
</ol>
<p>After some research, <a href="https://lutaonan.com">Randy&rsquo;s</a> <a href="https://cusdis.com/">Cusdis</a> caught my attention. Cusdis is an open-source comment system that prioritizes data privacy and is extremely lightweight, with a gzipped size of only about 5kb. From its name, you can tell that the developer was also frustrated with Disqus and created an alternative version. Therefore, it also supports importing historical data from Disqus, which is very thoughtful.</p>
<p>Although this is an early-stage project, it already provides email notifications and comment alerts through Webhook integration with Telegram, making it convenient for users to manage. Cusdis offers both free hosted services and self-hosted options. If you don&rsquo;t want to bother with setup, you can directly use the service provided by the author. Self-hosting requires a server and a PostgreSQL instance. We will mainly demonstrate the self-hosted approach.</p>
<p>In my previous article &ldquo;Building a Free Personal Blog Analytics System from Scratch (umami + Vercel + Heroku),&rdquo; I used <a href="http://vercel.com/">Vercel</a> and <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> for setup. As someone who enjoys tinkering, we&rsquo;ll use <a href="https://railway.app/">Railway</a> to build and deploy this comment system.</p>
<p>Railway is similar to Vercel, also a PaaS platform that supports deployment of projects in multiple languages. For personal projects, its $5 monthly free quota is more than enough. After testing, deploying the previous <a href="https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2022/03/24/free_blog_deploy_using_hugo_and_cusdis/">umami website analytics system</a> along with a PostgreSQL database instance on the Railway platform costs about $0.7 per month, which is completely sufficient for personal use.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/railway_price.png" alt="railway_price"></p>
<p>Compared to Vercel, it also supports deploying database instances, allowing you to deploy the database and instance together in a single project, reducing setup and maintenance costs. The following will record the specific setup and deployment process, which is very smooth due to official support for one-click deployment on Railway.</p>
<p><strong>[2024-06-30 Update]</strong></p>
<p>Given that Railway has discontinued its Free Plan since August last year, if you still want to use it completely free of charge, you can use Vercel/Netlify/Zeabur to deploy the main project for free, and deploy a free PostgreSQL database instance on Supabase, passing the connection as an environment variable to the Cusdis service. The rest of the process remains largely the same.</p>
<h2 id="setup-and-deployment-instructions">Setup and Deployment Instructions</h2>
<h3 id="one-click-deployment-of-service-and-database-instance-using-railway">One-Click Deployment of Service and Database Instance Using Railway</h3>
<p>First, register for a Railway account. You can use my <a href="https://railway.app?referralCode=J0F5LQ">invitation link</a>. After registration and login, click on New Project in the upper right corner to create a project.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/railway_dashboard.png" alt="railway_dashboard"></p>
<p>Then search for Cusdis and click on the appearing project to start deployment. The first few steps can also be done by clicking the <code>Deploy on Railway</code> button in the <a href="https://github.com/djyde/cusdis">Cusdis project repository</a> for one-click deployment.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/new_cusids_starter.png" alt="new_cusids_starter"></p>
<p>Before starting deployment, you need to manually enter three environment variables:</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/deploy_cusdis_on_railway.png" alt="deploy_cusdis_on_railway"></p>
<ol>
<li>USERNAME: Account for login</li>
<li>PASSWORD: Password for login</li>
<li>JWT_SECRET: A random string</li>
</ol>
<p>Other environment variables have been preset with default values, please do not modify them:</p>
<ol>
<li>NEXTAUTH_URL: <code>${{ RAILWAY_STATIC_URL }}</code></li>
<li>DB_TYPE: <code>pgsql</code></li>
<li>DB_URL: <code>${{ DATABASE_URL }}</code></li>
<li>PORT: <code>3000</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Click deploy and wait for completion. It will automatically deploy the service and initialize the database.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/cusdis_deploy_done.jpg" alt="cusdis_deploy_done"></p>
<h3 id="configuring-cusdis-script-for-personal-blog">Configuring Cusdis Script for Personal Blog</h3>
<p>After deployment, click on the link generated by the cusdis service to access the service Dashboard.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/cusdis_login.png" alt="cusdis_login"></p>
<p>Enter the username and password configured before deployment and click login. After logging in, click Dashboard to enter the project configuration page.</p>
<p>On first login, a pop-up will prompt you to configure the first website. Enter the website name to complete the addition. In the future, when we need to add a website, click New Website in the sidebar and fill in the website name to complete the addition.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/add_new_website.png" alt="add_new_website"></p>
<p>Since I have already configured my own website, the interface will show previous comment records.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/cusdis_dashboard.png" alt="cusdis_dashboard"></p>
<p>Next, click on Embed Code at the top and copy the code in the pop-up window.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/cusdis_embed_code.jpg" alt="cusdis_embed_code"></p>
<p>This part of the code needs to be modified partially according to the type of blog website you use. Refer to the Integration module in the <a href="https://cusdis.com/doc#/">official documentation</a> for specific configuration.</p>
<p>I use <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>, and the configuration is as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">div</span> <span class="na">id</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&#34;cusdis_thread&#34;</span>

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">  <span class="na">data-app-id</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&#34;xxx&#34;</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">  <span class="na">data-page-id</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&#34;{{ .File.UniqueID }}&#34;</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">  <span class="na">data-page-url</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&#34;{{ .Permalink }}&#34;</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">  <span class="na">data-page-title</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&#34;{{ .Title }}&#34;</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">div</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">script</span> <span class="na">defer</span> <span class="na">src</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&#34;https://cusdis.com/js/widget/lang/zh-cn.js&#34;</span><span class="p">&gt;&lt;/</span><span class="nt">script</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">script</span> <span class="na">async</span> <span class="na">defer</span> <span class="na">src</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&#34;xxx&#34;</span><span class="p">&gt;&lt;/</span><span class="nt">script</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The <code>data-host</code>, <code>data-app-id</code>, etc., need to be based on the content of the Embed Code just copied. The <code>&lt;script defer src=&quot;https://cusdis.com/js/widget/lang/zh-cn.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code> mainly implements Chinese localization. For support of different languages, see the <a href="https://cusdis.com/doc#/advanced/i18n">documentation i18n module</a>.</p>
<p>After modification, add it to the appropriate position of your blog (usually at the bottom). After configuration and deployment, you can see the comment box. The presentation effect is as follows:</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/cusdis_display.png" alt="cusdis_display"></p>
<h3 id="configuring-custom-domain">Configuring Custom Domain</h3>
<p>The domain automatically generated by Railway deployment is quite long and contains some characters, making it difficult to remember. We can configure a custom domain for the project in Railway.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/railway_custom_domain.jpg" alt="railway_custom_domain"></p>
<p>After entering the desired domain/subdomain, add DNS resolution according to the official instructions.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/railway_domain_dns.jpg" alt="railway_domain_dns"></p>
<p>For example, I use a domain hosted by <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com">Cloudflare</a>, so I need to add a CNAME DNS record for the domain first.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/cloudflare_domain_dns.jpg" alt="cloudflare_domain_dns"></p>
<p>At this point, our deployment is complete, and we can access the management backend through the domain to perform comment review and management.</p>
<h3 id="updating-the-project">Updating the Project</h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, Cusdis is still a developing project, and we want to update the new features released by the author as soon as possible. Railway provides a very convenient upstream branch management function, allowing you to set the parent project for the project and click to pull the latest updates, which is very convenient.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/railway_update_project.png" alt="railway_update_project"></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The above is the complete process of adding the Cusdis comment system to our website. After configuration, no subsequent maintenance is required. You can conveniently manage your website and review comments through the dashboard. The data is stored in a PostgreSQL database instance, making it easy to export, backup, and migrate. This is one of my blog setup and deployment series tutorials. Please stay tuned, and I hope it can be of reference to everyone.</p>

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>Recently, the school sent an email stating that they would be transitioning email services from Google to Microsoft, and the previously unlimited Google Drive storage would be discontinued, replaced by 5TB of OneDrive space. I had been using Google Drive&rsquo;s file service to synchronize and backup files across my multiple devices, accumulating nearly 300GB of data. Due to the slow download speeds of Google Drive in mainland China requiring a proxy, I opted for the officially recommended <a href="https://mover.io">mover.io</a> service to perform a cloud migration, eliminating the need to download and re-upload files locally. Here, I document the migration process.</p>
<h2 id="moverio-service">mover.io Service</h2>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/mover_io.png" alt="mover_io"></p>
<p>The mover.io service is a cloud storage migration tool provided by Microsoft. It supports the migration of files from various cloud service providers to Microsoft OneDrive, including Google Drive, Dropbox, Box, and others. It offers migration services for organizations, schools, and individuals alike.</p>
<p>For individual users, we utilize the Transfer Wizard to conduct the migration.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/mover_transfer_wizard.png" alt="mover_transfer_wizard"></p>
<h2 id="migration-process">Migration Process</h2>
<h3 id="registerlog-in-to-moverio-account">Register/Log in to mover.io Account</h3>
<p>First, we need to register a mover.io account and log in. You can use Microsoft authorization to log in or use your existing mover.io account.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/mover_io_login.png" alt="mover_io_login"></p>
<h3 id="authorize-migration-data-source">Authorize Migration Data Source</h3>
<p>After successful login, the interface clearly provides operational instructions. Simply follow the steps.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/mover_transfer_wizard_setting.png" alt="mover_transfer_wizard_setting"></p>
<h4 id="select-migration-source">Select Migration Source</h4>
<p>Click the Authorize New Connector button, choose Google Drive (Single User), select the Google account containing the files you wish to migrate, and authorize.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/mover_source_google.png" alt="mover_source_google"></p>
<p>Once authorized, a list of all files to be migrated will appear.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/mover_source_done.png" alt="mover_source_done"></p>
<h4 id="select-migration-destination">Select Migration Destination</h4>
<p>Click the Authorize New Connector button, choose OneDrive for Business (Single User), select this data source, and authorize. Currently, the destination data source only supports Microsoft family products like OneDrive and SharePoint.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/mover_choose_dest.png" alt="mover_choose_dest"></p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/mover_dest_onedrive.png" alt="mover_dest_onedrive"></p>
<p>After authorization, a file list of the migration destination cloud storage will appear.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/mover_dest_onedrive_done.png" alt="mover_dest_onedrive_done"></p>
<h3 id="migrate-data">Migrate Data</h3>
<p>Once both the source and destination data sources are set up, you can select Start Copy to begin the migration process.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/mover_start_copy.png" alt="mover_start_copy"></p>
<h3 id="wait-for-migration-completion">Wait for Migration Completion</h3>
<p>After completing the above operations, the migration process will commence. You only need to wait for it to finish. You can check the progress through the Migration Manager after logging in.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/mover_wait_migration_done.png" alt="mover_wait_migration_done"></p>
<p>Due to differences in source file sizes, migration times will vary for each individual. Based on testing, the migration speed reference is as follows:</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/mover_migration_speed.png" alt="mover_migration_speed"></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The above outlines the process I used to migrate all Google Drive files to OneDrive using the mover.io service. I hope this proves helpful to everyone.</p>

<p>Previously, I wrote an article titled &ldquo;Free Personal Blog System Setup and Deployment Solution (Hugo + GitHub Pages + Cusdis)&rdquo;, detailing my blog system built using Serverless and some open-source projects. I also started a series to document the setup process.</p>
<p>A few days ago, I came across an article by <a href="https://reorx.com">Reorx</a> titled &ldquo;Deploy umami for Personal Website Analytics&rdquo;. He introduced the <a href="https://umami.is">umami</a> project and demonstrated its serverless deployment using <a href="https://railway.app">Railway</a>.</p>
<p>However, since I had previously used <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>&rsquo;s free Postgres database service and deployed with <a href="http://vercel.com/">Vercel</a> when setting up <a href="https://cusdis.com">Cusdis</a>, I wanted to continue using these platforms for umami to reduce setup and maintenance costs.</p>
<p>The following text will record the specific setup and deployment process. Thanks to the official one-click deployment method, the entire setup process was very smooth.</p>
<p><strong>[2024-06-30 Update]</strong></p>
<p>Later, as Heroku discontinued its free plan, if you still want to use it completely free, you can use Vercel/Netlify/Zeabur for free deployment of the main project + Supabase for deploying PostgreSQL database instances. Pass the link as an environment variable to the Umami service. The rest of the process remains applicable.</p>
<h2 id="setup-and-deployment-instructions">Setup and Deployment Instructions</h2>
<h3 id="creating-a-postgres-database-with-heroku">Creating a Postgres Database with Heroku</h3>
<h4 id="creating-the-postgres-database">Creating the Postgres Database</h4>
<p>First, register for a Heroku account. After logging in successfully, click the button in the upper right corner to create a new application.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/cretae_app_in_heroku_1.png" alt="cretae_app_in_heroku_1"></p>
<p>Enter the instance name, and choose the region as you prefer. I selected United States. Click create.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/cretae_app_in_heroku_2.png" alt="cretae_app_in_heroku_2"></p>
<p>After creation, search and select the Postgres database in the Adds-on section of the Resources Tab.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/add_heroku_postgres.png" alt="add_heroku_postgres"></p>
<p>Choose the Free Plan. The Postgres database in Heroku is free and can be used continuously, eliminating setup and maintenance costs.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/heroku_postgres_plan.png" alt="heroku_postgres_plan"></p>
<p>After creation, check the <code>DATABASE_URL</code> in Settings, which will be used later for deployment.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/postgres_data_url.jpg" alt="postgres_data_url"></p>
<p>Click on the newly added Postgres add-on to proceed with settings.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/postgres_addon_details.png" alt="postgres_addon_details"></p>
<p>Once inside, select View Credentials in the Settings page and record the configuration parameters.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/heroku_credentials.png" alt="heroku_credentials"></p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/postgres_settings.jpg" alt="postgres_settings"></p>
<h4 id="initializing-the-postgres-database">Initializing the Postgres Database</h4>
<p>As database initialization is required, I used the DataGrip database management tool for connection, which is quite convenient. You can also connect and configure through the Heroku CLI.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/postgres_config.jpg" alt="postgres_config"></p>
<p>Umami needs to be initialized using the official <a href="https://github.com/mikecao/umami/blob/master/sql/schema.postgresql.sql">umami/sql/schema.postgresql.sql</a> script.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/postgres_init_script.png" alt="postgres_init_script"></p>
<p>After execution, the database will have five tables with initialized data, and you can proceed with subsequent deployment work.</p>
<h3 id="one-click-deployment-of-umami-service-using-vercel">One-Click Deployment of umami Service Using Vercel</h3>
<h4 id="deploying-the-umami-service">Deploying the umami Service</h4>
<p>After creating the database instance, you can deploy the umami service with one click through Vercel.</p>
<p>Visit the <a href="https://umami.is/docs/running-on-vercel">Running on Vercel</a> module in the <a href="https://umami.is">umami official documentation</a> for operation instructions and one-click deployment script.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/running_on_vercel.png" alt="running_on_vercel"></p>
<p>After clicking the one-click deployment button, you will be redirected to Vercel&rsquo;s one-click deployment page to create a Github repository for umami.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/vercel_create_umami_repo.png" alt="vercel_create_umami_repo"></p>
<p>Next, you need to enter the <code>DATABASE_URL</code> parameter address recorded when deploying the Heroku Postgres instance earlier, and you need to fill in a custom string <code>HASH_SLAT</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/vercel_config_umami.png" alt="vercel_config_umami"></p>
<p>Click Deploy to start deployment. It will be completed in a few minutes.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/vercel_deploy.png" alt="vercel_deploy"></p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/vecel_deploy_done.png" alt="vecel_deploy_done"></p>
<h4 id="accessing-the-umami-service">Accessing the umami Service</h4>
<p>After deployment, click Dashboard or the assigned Vercel domain to access the service. You will see the umami login interface.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/umami_login.png" alt="umami_login"></p>
<p>For the first login, enter the default username <code>admin</code> and default password <code>umami</code>. After successful login, you will be redirected to the umami management page. You can click on the avatar in the upper right corner to change your password.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/umami_change_password.png" alt="umami_change_password"></p>
<h4 id="configuring-personal-website-to-umami-service">Configuring Personal Website to umami Service</h4>
<p>After completing the basic account configuration, click on the Websites tab in the sidebar, then click Add Website.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/umami_add_website_1.png" alt="umami_add_website_1"></p>
<p>Fill in the basic website information. If you check the share link, it will generate a publicly accessible URL. I added it as a bookmark on my iPad&rsquo;s home screen, which also works great as a data dashboard.</p>

<h4 id="configuring-umami-script-to-personal-blog-website">Configuring umami Script to Personal Blog Website</h4>
<p>After creating the website, obtain the umami script.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/get_umami_script.jpg" alt="get_umami_script"></p>
<p>Once obtained, add the umami script to your personal website. I use the static blog Hugo, adding it within the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tag in the theme.</p>

<p>After configuration and deployment, you can start tracking website data.</p>

<h4 id="configuring-custom-script-name">Configuring Custom Script Name</h4>
<p>Using the official <code>umami.js</code> script name might be blocked by some filtering rules. Therefore, we can customize the script name to achieve more accurate website data tracking.</p>
<p>The official also provides a convenient modification method. You can add the <code>TRACKER_SCRIPT_NAME</code> environment variable in the umami service already deployed in Vercel, configuring it to a custom name.</p>

<p>After configuration, redeploy, and then change the script name in your personal website script.</p>

<h4 id="configuring-custom-domain">Configuring Custom Domain</h4>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t want to use the <code>vercel.app</code> domain provided by Vercel, you can add a custom domain in Vercel. Follow the official Vercel guide to configure <code>CNAME</code> etc. for your domain provider.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/set_custom_domain.png" alt="set_custom_domain"></p>
<p>For example, I use a domain hosted by <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com">Cloudflare</a>, so I need to add domain resolution first.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/cloudflare_canme_config.png" alt="cloudflare_canme_config"></p>
<p>According to the official instructions, Cloudflare also needs to add a page rule. After configuration, you can complete the custom domain configuration.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The above is the complete process of adding the umami website statistics service to our website. Once configured, it requires no subsequent maintenance and allows for convenient website data tracking through the dashboard. This is one of my blog setup and deployment series tutorials. Please stay tuned, and I hope it can be of reference to everyone.</p>
