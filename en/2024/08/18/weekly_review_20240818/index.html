I&rsquo;ve had some thoughts and the desire to share, most of which I&rsquo;ve already posted. This is more of a compilation.</p><h2 id=the-roi-of-blogging>The ROI of Blogging</h2><p><img src=https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/blog_roi_x_discussion.jpg alt=blog_roi_x_discussion></p><p>A few days ago, I saw some discussions about blogging on Twitter, and then I read Innei&rsquo;s article &ldquo;From Disliking Writing to Enjoying Sharing: My Journey with Blogging&rdquo;. It was quite interesting, so I took the opportunity to carefully review my entire blogging journey and gains.</p><p>My personal conclusion is that I also feel blogging is a high-cost, long-term endeavor, but with a very high ROI.</p><p>If we consider writing from the heart in a broad sense, I&rsquo;ve been writing essays, public accounts, and blogs since high school, continuing for nearly 10 years. The direct income I&rsquo;ve earned from my writing is probably only about 3000 yuan in royalties from six or seven articles that made it to the homepage of Sspai, and a $5 monthly GitHub Sponsor donation from a reader who has persisted for over a year.</p><p>I had psychological expectations from the start. Apart from company salaries, whether it&rsquo;s creating products or writing, it&rsquo;s not easy to get users/readers to pay even a dollar for you. But as Randy said in an article on Notepal, the significance of &ldquo;someone willing to pay&rdquo; is far greater than the size of the amount.</p><p>Blogging has also brought many potential meanings and returns. When I interviewed for my current company last year, a colleague who was an interviewer at the time said that the entire team had read my weekly reviews before the interview and already had a preliminary understanding of my personality, technical skills, and learning ability. On social media, I&rsquo;ve also had more and deeper exchanges and even collaborations with many people I greatly admire through my writing. At many offline events, after a simple self-introduction, I often hear &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve read your weekly reviews, I really like them.&rdquo;</p><p>These are surprises harvested in long-term persistence, not for this purpose.</p><p>Whether it&rsquo;s blogging or other forms of creation, they all seem to follow a similar path. Initially fresh and motivated; gradually losing confidence in the long cycle, seeing other good articles/works and feeling pressure rather than beauty - &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t I write like that&rdquo;; slowly settling back to oneself, being free, happy, and enjoying it.</p><h2 id=the-colors-of-my-life>The Colors of My Life</h2><p><img src=https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/colored_camera.jpeg alt=colored_camera></p><p>I remember when I first started writing weekly reviews, I wrote &ldquo;Weekly Review #09 - The Colorless Yu and His Year of Pilgrimage&rdquo; after reading a Murakami novel. In it, I wrote:</p><blockquote><p>In the small group that Tsukuru belonged to, the names of the other four members and the close friend he later met all coincidentally included color words: &ldquo;red&rdquo;, &ldquo;blue&rdquo;, &ldquo;black&rdquo;, &ldquo;white&rdquo;, &ldquo;gray&rdquo;, making him feel like he was a characterless existence, along with a colorless life.</p><p>Actually, complaints about one&rsquo;s own name are common. In &ldquo;Reply 1988&rdquo;, Deok-sun also complained to her parents that her name had no character, unlike her sister Bora. I once had such thoughts too, feeling that my name was short and unremarkable, and being one of the common surnames, I often encountered many people with the same name in a school. Accompanying this was the feeling that I often needed to make extra effort to leave more memorable impressions.</p><p>Although I later reconciled with myself, I still often felt that my life was incompatible with being interesting. I always envied others&rsquo; interesting personalities and experiences, and even when I did well, I only felt like I was fulfilling the duties of my ordinary life or that these achievements didn&rsquo;t belong to me.</p></blockquote><p>Just like that, ordinary me often hesitates, wondering if my &ldquo;diary-like&rdquo; life is worth presenting to everyone, until recently when I happened to see a video on Bilibili - &ldquo;What is Good Color? After Five Years of Filming, What Has My Color Grading Become&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s about color grading, but a sentence in it deeply moved me:</p><blockquote><p>When I first turned the camera on myself, I discovered that filming could be so comfortable, without pressure. It was then that I realized what I had envied before was not that image, but the romantic and passionate life behind it. This is the meaning of my love for tinkering, I want to show you the world through my eyes, and the most beautiful color in my screen is the background color of my life.</p></blockquote><p>This is the most apt description of my current state of mind when writing weekly reviews.</p><h2 id=blog-setup-series>Blog Setup Series</h2><p>The blog setup series is finally complete! Altogether, there are as many as 10 articles, and I can consider myself to have entered the blog decoration arena.</p><p>From not knowing how to use Vercel deployment at the beginning, to now having played with almost all the Serverless options on the market, it&rsquo;s been a very interesting experience. The feeling of everything working according to your ideas is truly wonderful, and setting up a blog and writing a blog indeed each have their own joys.</p><h2 id=setup-tutorials>Setup Tutorials</h2><h3 id=2024-version>2024 Version</h3><blockquote><p>Compared to two years ago, the publishing process and appearance have hardly changed, but the components and content are already quite different.</p></blockquote><ul><li><a href=https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2024/06/29/what_changed_in_my_blog_2024/>What Changed in My Blog in 2024</a></li><li><a href=https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2024/07/22/free_commenting_system_using_remark42_and_flyio/>Build Your Free Blog Comment System from Scratch (Remark42 + fly.io)</a></li><li><a href=https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2024/08/06/deploy_web_statistics_system_using_goatcounter_and_zeabur/>Set Up a Website Statistics System Using GoatCounter and Zeabur</a></li><li><a href=https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2024/06/30/free_image_hosting_system_using_r2_webp_cloud_and_picgo/>Build Your Free Image Hosting System from Scratch (Cloudflare R2 + WebP Cloud + PicGo)</a></li><li><a href=https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2024/07/02/protect_your_image_using_webp_and_cloudflare_waf/>Add Privacy and Copyright Protection to Your Image Hosting Using WebP and Cloudflare WAF</a></li></ul><h3 id=2022-version>2022 Version</h3><blockquote><p>Except for some changes in platforms, many no longer provide Free Plans, but the process is still basically applicable.</p></blockquote><ul><li><a href=https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2022/06/12/why_i_still_write_blog_in_2022/>It&rsquo;s 2022, Let&rsquo;s Talk About Why I&rsquo;m Still Blogging</a></li><li><a href=https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2022/03/24/free_blog_deploy_using_hugo_and_cusdis/>Free Personal Blog System Setup and Deployment Solution (Hugo + GitHub Pages + Cusdis)</a></li><li><a href=https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2022/05/29/deploy_your_blog_using_hugo_and_github_action/>Hugo + GitHub Action, Build Your Blog Automatic Publishing System</a></li><li><a href=https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2022/05/21/free_blog_analysis_using_umami_vercel_and_heroku/>Build a Free Personal Blog Data Analysis System from Scratch (umami + Vercel + Heroku)</a></li><li><a href=https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2022/05/24/free_and_lightweight_blog_comment_system_using_cusdis_and_railway/>Lightweight Open Source Free Blog Comment System Solution (Cusdis + Railway)</a></li></ul><p>I wonder what I&rsquo;ll be doing and thinking about the next time I update this series.</p><h2 id=multilingual-support>Multilingual Support</h2><p><img src=https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/en_version_blog.png alt=en_version_blog></p><p>Actually, my blog has always had bilingual functionality options (you can switch the entire site in the navigation bar / directly click the corresponding language to switch in articles), but I&rsquo;ve always been lazy so I just copied the Chinese documents over. This morning, I translated all existing articles through Claude&rsquo;s Projects feature.</p><p>I created a new Blog Translation Project, input a global Instruction, and then just threw in the Hugo markdown source files.</p><p>The model used is Claude 3.5 Sonnet. To save context, I opened a new conversation for each article. I found that after translating over 130 articles, it still hadn&rsquo;t triggered Claude Pro&rsquo;s usage limit (at 9:40 am it reminded me that only 10 messages were left before 10 am, and it never appeared again after that), which seems quite conscientious.</p><p>Because my main goal today was to complete the conversion and rough proofreading of all articles, and I will still manually proofread the content later, I used a relatively simple Prompt. However, the usability of the returned format and the quality of the translation were beyond imagination.</p><blockquote><p>You will receive a Chinese blog post in Markdown format (.md) using the Hugo template. Translate the content into English, adhering to the following guidelines:</p><ol><li>Use a literary tone for posts in the &ldquo;Idea&rdquo; category; otherwise, employ a professional tone.</li><li>Maintain consistent terminology, especially for structural elements like &ldquo;preface&rdquo; and &ldquo;conclusion&rdquo;.</li><li>Preserve all Markdown formatting and metadata, including Hugo properties, links, audio, images, and other elements.</li><li>Translate only the blog content itself.</li><li>Return the result in Markdown format for easy copying.</li><li>Do not add any introductory statements, explanations, or additional content to the blog.</li><li>Provide only the raw translated Markdown content in your response.</li></ol></blockquote><h2 id=interesting-things-and-objects>Interesting Things and Objects</h2><h3 id=input>Input</h3><p>Although most interesting inputs are automatically synchronized in the &ldquo;Yu&rsquo;s Life&rdquo; Telegram channel, I&rsquo;ll still select some to list here, which feels more like a newsletter.
