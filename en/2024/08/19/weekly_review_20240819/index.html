With the emergence of ChatGPT, Perplexity, Devv.ai, and Claude, I&rsquo;ve become a heavy paid user of all of them. Mentally, I&rsquo;ve grown accustomed to using AI to help me write code, but it&rsquo;s mostly been for completing partial logic and debugging. It hasn&rsquo;t been capable of project-level assistance.</p><p>However, with Cursor&rsquo;s ability to use the entire project as context, @ other files or code when asking questions, and its use of the Claude 3.5 Sonnet model, the experience and usability are getting closer and closer to what I&rsquo;ve imagined.</p><p><img src=https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/web3insights_demo.png alt=web3insights_demo></p><p>In practice, during the 15-day Pro trial, I resolved some Go-related bug fixes and added new tests for my work; improved an update notification interface and functionality for an Electron application; helped me write a Rust backend CRUD API from scratch, including a complete Dockerfile and GitHub Action section; assisted me in completing the data visualization part of a Remix project and adjusting many interfaces, down to the interactions and layouts between individual pages; and even helped me learn some SwiftUI on the side.</p><p>I estimate that over 50% of my code is now written with AI assistance or even directly generated by AI. I spend more of my time in the &ldquo;CMD + K&rdquo; dialog box (Cursor&rsquo;s code generation shortcut) communicating requirements to the AI, organizing prompts (mostly expressed in natural conversational language). During the dialogue or while waiting for code generation, I actually have more time to think about code architecture, logic, and more suitable third-party libraries.</p><p>In fact, when helping AI understand my needs, I&rsquo;m also constantly reflecting on their rationality, which in turn leads to producing code with better functionality and quality. As for syntax and coding style, I often directly study and learn from AI&rsquo;s implementations, which is much easier to grasp than starting from scratch with an open-source project.</p><p>What I need to do is design and create.</p><p>As Randy quoted in his article <a href=https://lutaonan.com/blog/code-artists/>&ldquo;Code Artists&rdquo; Will Not Be Replaced by AI</a>:</p><blockquote><p>I realize the reason I like building is not just because I&rsquo;m a builder.</p><p>It&rsquo;s because software products are how I express my creativity.</p><p>It&rsquo;s like a poem to a poet, a song to a songwriter, a painting to a painter…</p><p>Software is my art form, my medium of expression.</p></blockquote><h2 id=ethshenzhen-hackathon>ETHShenzhen Hackathon</h2><p><img src=https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/web3insights_ethshenzhen_demo.jpg alt=web3insights_ethshenzhen_demo></p><p>The project mentioned above was part of an event I participated in over the weekend in Shenzhen. It was actually my first time properly participating as a contestant in a Hackathon. I spent two sleepless nights completing the Demo, wrote a basic speech outline and a few brief PPT slides on-site, and finally delivered the Demo presentation. It was more tiring than I had imagined, and I only got a good night&rsquo;s sleep on Sunday.</p><h2 id=the-source-of-learning-motivation>The Source of Learning Motivation</h2><p>One night, a conversation that started with choosing a skateboard for my sister led to a late-night talk with my senior about past experiences and various interests and hobbies.</p><p>My eclectic skill tree and range of interests are quite extensive. During my student years, I tried various sports, big and small, and became fairly proficient in most; as a child, I used to cruise the streets on one of those twist skateboards; I stuck with roller skating from elementary school through university, participating in the roller skating club for nearly ten years; I naturally learned to swim while playing at the swimming pool with my cousin; after entering university, I dabbled in photography, learned video editing, flew drones around campus, and even set up a studio where I explored various lighting and set designs; I did an internship in auditing, and even when starting a business, I handled company registration, financial reporting, invoice issuance, enterprise clearing and settlement declaration, and deregistration processes on my own for nearly two years without the help of intermediaries or financial professionals; in my work, I&rsquo;m always curious about various programming languages and frameworks, frequently trying out new ones.</p><p>I seem to have always had this tendency towards self-taught learning, as well as abruptly stopping once I&rsquo;ve learned just enough to meet my immediate needs, without much desire to delve deeper. For example, I consider myself fond of photography, and even had thoughts of making it my career when I was running a photography and video-related studio startup. But over all these years, I never really systematically studied composition, lighting, color, or photo editing. The same goes for video shooting and editing – I never built a foundation in dramatic theory or directorial thinking. I would only quickly learn a specific technique or function when I needed it, which was sufficient but just barely so.</p><p>I carefully analyzed my inner self and discovered some interesting phenomena, tracing back to my childhood and even earlier.</p><p>When I transferred to a school in Hangzhou at a very young age, I spent a lot of time trying to speak without an accent and it took several years for my grades to gradually reach above average. I also experienced some discrimination and unfairness, which accumulated into a fair amount of insecurity. It wasn&rsquo;t until middle school, when I met some great teachers, that my life and studies slowly got on track.</p><p>At this point, I started receiving a different kind of evaluation: <strong>&ldquo;You must have worked really hard to achieve xxx.&rdquo;</strong></p><p>I&rsquo;m not denying the importance of &ldquo;hard work,&rdquo; but being told this so often always felt somewhat defeating. It seemed that even I believed that I was inherently inferior to others and only achieved more because I worked harder, falling into a vicious cycle of Impostor syndrome.</p><p>So I gradually started to be less &ldquo;hardworking,&rdquo; as if trying to prove to others and myself that I could do these things &ldquo;effortlessly.&rdquo; Gradually, I even began to enjoy it.</p><p>What often brings me joy is not the knowledge I&rsquo;ve acquired or applying it to achieve something, but rather the psychological positive feedback of &ldquo;learning something new&rdquo; and &ldquo;being able to learn it quickly.&rdquo; This has brought me some benefits, such as the confidence accumulated from randomly developing various skills, which makes me less afraid when facing new things or seemingly distant goals —</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;If my past self could achieve so much, my current self surely can too.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>But it also sometimes prevents me from focusing on doing one thing well, or excelling in something I truly enjoy. It gives me breadth but lacks depth, which feels like a trade-off. Slowly, I&rsquo;m starting to make some changes.</p><h2 id=personal-life-snapshots>Personal Life Snapshots</h2><h3 id=400-days-anniversary>400 Days Anniversary</h3><p><img src=https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/love_record_400.jpg alt=love_record_400></p><p>It&rsquo;s been 400 days with my senior.</p><h2 id=interesting-things-and-objects>Interesting Things and Objects</h2><h3 id=input>Input</h3><p>Although most interesting inputs are automatically synced to the &ldquo;<a href=https://t.me/pseudoyulife>Yu&rsquo;s Life</a>&rdquo; Telegram channel, I&rsquo;ll still select a few to list here, making it feel more like a newsletter.
