Analytics System Solution Compared to the blog itself and the commenting system, I hadn&amp;rsquo;t paid much attention to an analytics system for a long time (mainly because there weren&amp;rsquo;t many readers back then).</description></item><item><title>Build Your Free Blog Comment System from Scratch (Remark42 + fly.io)</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2024/07/22/free_commenting_system_using_remark42_and_flyio/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jul 2024 01:10:42 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2024/07/22/free_commenting_system_using_remark42_and_flyio/</guid><description>Preface In the article &amp;ldquo;What Changed in My Blog in 2024&amp;rdquo;, I introduced the blog system I built using Serverless platforms and some open-source projects, and also started this series of tutorials to document the entire process of building and deploying.

While using WebP Cloud, I discovered it offered features like custom Proxy User Agent and watermarking. This sparked an idea: could I use WebP Cloud to protect the source links of my image hosting, making WebP Cloud&amp;rsquo;s proxy links the sole entry point for accessing all my images, while also uniformly adding my exclusive copyright watermark?</description></item><item><title>Build Your Free Image Hosting System from Scratch (Cloudflare R2 + WebP Cloud + PicGo)</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2024/06/30/free_image_hosting_system_using_r2_webp_cloud_and_picgo/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Jun 2024 14:12:47 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2024/06/30/free_image_hosting_system_using_r2_webp_cloud_and_picgo/</guid><description>Preface In the article &amp;ldquo;What Changed in My Blog in 2024&amp;rdquo;, I introduced the blog system I built using Serverless platforms and some open-source projects, and also started this series of tutorials to document the entire build and deployment process.

My personal blog and some knowledge base projects are generated using hugo and hosted on GitHub Pages. This approach is convenient for version control and deployment maintenance, but for non-technical individuals, using command-line git operations can be overly complex, and it&amp;rsquo;s not particularly convenient for scenarios involving multiple collaborators.
