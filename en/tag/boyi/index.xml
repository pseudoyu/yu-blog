Time has flown by, and two to three weeks have passed unnoticed. I comfort myself by saying that shifting each post forward by a week will soon restore the weekly updates. However, these weeks have not been idle. I&amp;rsquo;ve read some books, perused several articles that greatly impacted me, participated in some interesting activities, tinkered with many intriguing things, rebuilt my knowledge management system, and made orderly progress in both my main work and additional interests.</description></item><item><title>Weekly Review #44 - The Silent Workers, xLog and Daily Life</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2023/08/15/weekly_review_20230815/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Aug 2023 10:01:24 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2023/08/15/weekly_review_20230815/</guid><description>&amp;#39;Tenderness - Mayday&amp;#39; Preface This piece is a record and reflection of my life from 2023-07-11 to 2023-08-15.
After nearly a month of stagnation, reopening the weekly review document felt somewhat unfamiliar. In truth, many themes I wanted to write about had accumulated, and there were many words I wished to say. Although my output has decreased, my desire to share has not diminished due to changes in my life state.</description></item><item><title>Weekly Review #43 - In the Mood for Love</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2023/07/10/weekly_review_20230710/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jul 2023 02:22:24 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2023/07/10/weekly_review_20230710/</guid><description>&amp;#39;Not Spring, Love, or Cherry Blossoms&amp;#39; - HIGH4&amp;amp;IU Preface This piece is a record and reflection of my life from June 22 to July 10, 2023.
The past few weeks have been both long and fleeting, filled with numerous events and thoughts I&amp;rsquo;ve been eager to express. Yet, something in the depths of my heart has repeatedly held me back from putting pen to paper. It&amp;rsquo;s as if everything isn&amp;rsquo;t quite ready, and I find myself at a loss for words, wanting to tell a good story but unsure where to begin.</description></item><item><title>Weekly Review #42 - Views on Love, Life State and Self</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2023/06/21/weekly_review_20230621/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jun 2023 10:03:24 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2023/06/21/weekly_review_20230621/</guid><description>&amp;#39;Tenderness - Mayday&amp;#39; Preface This is a record and reflection of my life from 2023-06-13 to 2023-06-21.
