If it weren&amp;rsquo;t for xLog&amp;rsquo;s incentive, I might have skipped this weekly review.
In the past week or so, a series of events unfolded: Nini fell ill, my parents drove to Beijing to pick up the cat (and me), I accompanied them sightseeing (though it was my first time at all the attractions too), met with friends before parting ways, endured a 15-hour cross-city journey, found a new apartment (though it only took an hour to sign the lease), moved and decorated the new place, and started a new job.</description></item><item><title>Weekly Review #34 - Don't Stop the Clocks</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2023/03/13/weekly_review_20230313/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Mar 2023 17:29:49 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2023/03/13/weekly_review_20230313/</guid><description>&amp;#39;Don&amp;#39;t Stop the Clocks - King Gnu&amp;#39; Preface This piece is a record and reflection of my life from 2023-03-08 to 2023-03-13. This week was primarily focused on work handovers, which wasn&amp;rsquo;t as busy as before, but the pressing time and impending tasks still brought considerable pressure. After all, I&amp;rsquo;m about to leave a city I&amp;rsquo;ve lived in for nearly two years. More time was spent on conversations and gatherings,</description></item><item><title>2022 Year-End Review - Confusion, Low Points and Change</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2022/12/31/yearly_review_2022/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Dec 2022 14:18:37 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2022/12/31/yearly_review_2022/</guid><description>&amp;#39;Here After Us - Mayday&amp;#39; Preface Today is the last day of 2022. As I mentioned in my previous weekly review:
There will be an annual summary, covering various events of my year - things lost, things gained, things to be grateful for, and inevitable regrets. Though I hesitated about bringing up certain topics again, I decided to face them truthfully. After all, everything expires, even canned pineapples. This year too shall pass.</description></item><item><title>Confession at 25: A Love Like a Flower Bouquet</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2022/06/06/yearly_review_25/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jun 2022 00:01:29 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2022/06/06/yearly_review_25/</guid><description>Preface Today is June 6, 2022, and I am 25 years old. In truth, since that article I wrote two years ago on this day, &amp;ldquo;Confessions at 23: Pursuing Meaning,&amp;rdquo; I had intended to write one every year, as a way to account for the year past, whether it was splendid or mundane. Much indeed happened when I was 23, but each time I opened a blank document, I found</description></item><item><title>Confessions at 23: Seeking Meaning</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2020/06/06/yearly_review_23/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2020/06/06/yearly_review_23/</guid><description>Confessions of a 23-Year-Old: Seeking Meaning Today is June 6, 2020, and I am 23 years old. This age seems to be an awkward existence. If defined by life stages, my undergraduate graduation is already a year behind, yet it&amp;rsquo;s still too early for two zodiac years. My life experience is far from sufficient to offer advice to others, but I still want to write something to account for my past few years.</description></item></channel></rss>
