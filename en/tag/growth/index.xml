The idea for the weekly review was born on my birthday two years ago. As I mentioned in last year&amp;rsquo;s summary, this is a column and ritual I want to keep up, and it has arrived as promised.
In the first year, I wrote 40 weekly reviews, but last year there were only 20. What decreased wasn&amp;rsquo;t just the quantity, but also my reflections, emotions, and desire for expression.</description></item><item><title>Confession at 26: The Stone-Pusher</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2023/06/06/yearly_review_26/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jun 2023 19:42:26 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2023/06/06/yearly_review_26/</guid><description>&amp;#39;Here After Us - Mayday&amp;#39; Confession at 26: The Stone-Pusher It is now June 6, 2023, and I am 26 years old. As I grow older, I no longer feel much ceremony or anticipation for my birthday itself. Yet, it still serves as a milestone, reminding me that another year has passed. Since last year, I decided to leave some words on my birthday and New Year&amp;rsquo;s Eve, as a way to account for the time that has elapsed.</description></item><item><title>Weekly Review #03 - Health, Goals and the Rhythm of Life</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2022/07/11/weekly_review_20220711/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Jul 2022 08:30:20 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2022/07/11/weekly_review_20220711/</guid><description>&amp;#39;Here After Us - Mayday&amp;#39; Preface It seems that every time I start with the title, I try to set a theme for the past week. Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s not that easy to summarize, but I still persist in doing so. Perhaps this way, life will be like a series of chapters pieced together, and when looking back after a long time, it will feel like a fulfilling book.
This piece is a record and reflection of my life from 2022-07-04 to 2022-07-10.</description></item><item><title>Weekly Review #02 - Work, Anxiety and Growth</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2022/07/03/weekly_review_20220703/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Jul 2022 12:54:39 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2022/07/03/weekly_review_20220703/</guid><description>&amp;#39;Here After Us - Mayday&amp;#39; Preface It&amp;rsquo;s been a full year since I started working in Beijing after my internship.
I&amp;rsquo;ve always been a person with an inexplicable sense of ritual. At this juncture, I frequently reflect on my thoughts, gains, anxieties, and regrets from this past year. I often wonder, on this day a year ago, what would that nervous yet expectant version of myself have hoped to gain from the year ahead?</description></item></channel></rss>
