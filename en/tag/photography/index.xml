Due to long periods of staying in my small room and lacking the mood to explore, its four seasons have merely been the changing greenery on my way to work. I haven&amp;rsquo;t even visited the most well-known landmarks.
In fact, I&amp;rsquo;ve moved between quite a few cities over the years. Each time, I always thought, &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s still time,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;There are plenty of days ahead,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;There will always be a chance,&amp;rdquo; yet often left with many regrets.</description></item><item><title>Photography Collection #01 - Cat In The Box</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2023/01/01/cat_in_the_box/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2023 21:18:03 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2023/01/01/cat_in_the_box/</guid><description>Preface Since November, I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to take proper photos of Nini, but the lighting at home isn&amp;rsquo;t ideal.

Work gradually became busier but also more interesting; daily life saw some changes, no longer so dull and mundane; I&amp;rsquo;ve grown accustomed to pulling out my Kindle for a few pages even during short car rides of just a few dozen minutes, quickly becoming immersed; going out has become more frequent, even if it&amp;rsquo;s just aimlessly walking the streets.</description></item></channel></rss>
