This week and a half has been quite eventful. Work has been somewhat busy. I participated in the Adventure X event, which was a lot of fun. I experimented with the Remix framework and prepared for a workshop. I met with Randy, and together we planned the redesign and subsequent development of EpubKit, essentially holding our own hackathon for us &amp;ldquo;middle-aged hippies&amp;rdquo; who couldn&amp;rsquo;t participate in the competition.</description></item></channel></rss>
