Cyberspace I previously learned about the concept of &amp;ldquo;cyberspace&amp;rdquo; from Reorx&amp;rsquo;s article &amp;ldquo;Using Automated Workflows to Aggregate Information Intake and Output&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>ICOM6045 Topic 1 Cryptography</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2020/10/21/icom6045_topic1/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Oct 2020 19:53:17 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2020/10/21/icom6045_topic1/</guid><description>ICOM6045 Fundamentals of E-Commerce Security Topic 1 Cryptography Definition Process of transforming information to make it unreadable to anyone except those possessing the key Purpose Data confidentiality Transpositions/Permutations An encryption in which the letters of the message are rearranged Function Try to break established patterns Example Columnar transposition Rearrangement of the characters of the plaintext into columns Based on characteristic patterns of pairs of adjacent letters, called digrams Analysis Compute the letter frequencies Break the text into columns by compare a block of ciphertext characters against characters successively farther away in the ciphertext.</description></item><item><title>ICOM6012 Topic 4 Transport Layer</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2020/10/20/icom6012_topic4/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Oct 2020 09:37:44 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2020/10/20/icom6012_topic4/</guid><description>ICOM6012 Internet Infrastructure Technologies Topic 4 Transport Layer Actions Sender Get application layer message Determine segment header fields values Create segment Pass segment to IP Receiver Receive segment from IP Check header values Extract application layer message Demultiplexes message up to application via socket Services Provide logical communication between processes Run in end system Send side Break app messages into segment Pass to network layer Receive side Reassembles segments into messages Pass to application layer Protocols TCP Features Point-to-point One sender, one receiver Reliable, in-order byte system No message boundaries Full duplex data Bi-directional data flow in same connection MSS: maximum segment size (excluding header) Cumulative ACKs Pipelining TCP congestion and flow control set window size Flow Control Sender will not overwhelm receiver Congestion control Concepts Segment structure Sequence numbers Byte stream &amp;ldquo;number&amp;rdquo; of first byte in segment&amp;rsquo;s data Acknowledgements (ACKs) Seq # of next byte expected from other side Cumulative ACKs Procedure Connection-oriented Handshaking initializes sender, receiver state before data exchange TCP socket identified by 4-tuple Source IP Source Port # Dest IP Dest Port # Server host may support many simultaneous TCP sockets Web servers have different sockets for each connecting client (Non-persistent HTTP will have different socket for each request) Demux Receiver uses all four values to direct segment to appropriate socket 3-way handshake Connection setup Connection management Handshake Agree to establish connection Agree on connection parameters Retransmission Closing a connection Events Data received from application Create segment with seq # (a byte-stream number of first data byte in segment) Start timer if not already running Think of timer as for oldest unACKed segment Expiration interval: TimeOutInterval Timeout Retransmit segment that caused timeout Restart timer ACK received Update what is known to ACKed Start timer if there are still unACKed segment Shortcomings SYN DoS Attack Half-open TCP connections consume all the TCP connection resources SYN packet with a spoofed source address UDP Features</description></item><item><title>ICOM6012 Topic 3 Application Layer</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2020/10/19/icom6012_topic3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Oct 2020 17:50:44 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2020/10/19/icom6012_topic3/</guid><description>ICOM6012 Internet Infrastructure Technologies Topic 3 Application Layer Creating a Network App Run on different end systems Communication over network No need to write for network-core devices Client-Server Architecture (The Centralized Internet) Server Always-on host Permanent IP address Often in data centers (for scaling) Clients Contact, communicate with server May be intermittently connected May have dynamic IP addresses Don&amp;rsquo;t communicate directly with each other Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Architecture No always-on server</description></item><item><title>ICOM6012 Topic 2 The Big Picture</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2020/10/05/icom6012_topic2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Oct 2020 09:06:09 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2020/10/05/icom6012_topic2/</guid><description>ICOM6012 Internet Infrastructure Technologies Topic 2 The Big Picture The Internet: &amp;ldquo;nuts and bolts&amp;rdquo; view
