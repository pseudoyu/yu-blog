I concentrated on writing a contract project that wasn&amp;rsquo;t particularly complex, and also revisited my learning experience and insights on contract development due to an interview with a content creator friend, continuing to produce my series of tutorials. A publishing house contacted me, and I might start writing a technical book, which I&amp;rsquo;m both looking forward to and feeling a bit anxious about.</description></item><item><title>Implementing Two-Phase Commit in Solidity Smart Contracts Using State Locks</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2022/07/01/two_phase_commit_contract_practice_in_solidity/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jul 2022 10:54:57 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2022/07/01/two_phase_commit_contract_practice_in_solidity/</guid><description>《后来的我们 - 五月天》 Preface In smart contract applications involving interactions between multiple systems or contracts, particularly in businesses where asset or data accuracy is sensitive, we need to ensure data atomicity throughout the entire business process. Therefore, we need to implement a mechanism similar to multi-phase commit at the contract level, which decomposes the state change process in the contract into two</description></item><item><title>Solidity Smart Contract Development - Using the Hardhat Framework</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2022/06/09/learn_solidity_from_scratch_hardhat/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jun 2022 14:38:10 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2022/06/09/learn_solidity_from_scratch_hardhat/</guid><description>&amp;#39;Here After Us - Mayday&amp;#39; Preface After the previous articles on smart contract basics, Web3.py, and ethers.js, we have mastered the fundamental knowledge of interacting directly with blockchain networks through programs. For those unfamiliar, you can review:
Solidity Smart Contract Development - Basics Solidity Smart Contract Development - Mastering Web3.py Solidity Smart Contract Development - Mastering ethers.js However, in real complex business scenarios, we often use some further encapsulated frameworks, such as HardHat, Brownie, Truffle, etc.</description></item><item><title>Solidity Smart Contract Development - Mastering ethers.js</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2022/06/08/learn_solidity_from_scratch_ethersjs/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jun 2022 00:25:45 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2022/06/08/learn_solidity_from_scratch_ethersjs/</guid><description>《後來的我們 - 五月天》 Preface In the previous article &amp;ldquo;Solidity Smart Contract Development - Basics&amp;rdquo;, we learned the basic syntax of Solidity and understood that we can debug using frameworks like Brownie and HardHat. In another article &amp;ldquo;Solidity Smart Contract Development - Mastering Web3.py&amp;rdquo;, we also interacted directly with our local Ganache node using Web3.py.

In this course, I learned about Ethereum smart contract development and created a simple library management ÐApp. For my graduation project, I chose to develop a music copyright application based on Ethereum, which can be found at Uright - Blockchain Music Copyright Management ÐApp. Through these experiences, I gained a basic understanding of Solidity development.</description></item></channel></rss>
