Due to the pandemic, I had been staying at home in Hangzhou. As the weather turned cooler and I hadn&amp;rsquo;t brought many clothes, I bought a ticket back to Beijing as soon as my health code turned green. I returned to Beijing on Friday. In just half a month, my home had become quite messy, so I spent almost the entire weekend cleaning and organizing.</description></item><item><title>Weekly Review #14 - Suspended Life and Self</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2022/10/09/weekly_review_20221009/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Oct 2022 09:51:31 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2022/10/09/weekly_review_20221009/</guid><description>&amp;#39;Here After Us - Mayday&amp;#39; Preface This piece is a record and reflection of my life from September 27, 2022 to October 9, 2022.
This is a weekly review spanning quite a long period.

The past week has been somewhat busy, oscillating between several projects, so I haven&amp;rsquo;t had much input. I had to work over the weekend but didn&amp;rsquo;t want to stay cooped up at home, so I went out and unexpectedly found a nice caf√© where I spent a pleasant day.

In terms of work rhythm, it was far from busy, and I even got home as early as 7 p.m. on several days, which was rare. The extra leisure time allowed me to think more about my personality and state of life, and to organize many previously scattered thoughts.</description></item></channel></rss>
