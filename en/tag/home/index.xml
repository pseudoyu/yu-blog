Perhaps due to my recent change in lifestyle, I had planned numerous engagements as early as March. From the beginning of April, I found myself wandering, experiencing a fortnight of leisure. This journey was akin to a homecoming - departing from Hangzhou where I was raised, to Wuhan, the first place I left home for an extended period, to visit my professor and old friends, and finally to Hong Kong, where I spent some remarkable years, to attend exhibitions and events.</description></item><item><title>Weekly Review #36 - Gastroenteritis, Nini's Update, and New Journeys</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2023/04/02/weekly_review_20230402/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Apr 2023 12:01:26 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2023/04/02/weekly_review_20230402/</guid><description>&amp;#39;Don&amp;#39;t Stop the Clocks - King Gnu&amp;#39; Preface This piece is a record and reflection of my life from 2023-03-25 to 2023-04-02.
Never did I imagine that as a southerner who lived in Hangzhou for over a decade, I would suffer severe adaptation issues upon returning to live in Hangzhou.
In the previous post, I mentioned that Nini was a bit sick due to the bumpy journey and other factors.</description></item><item><title>Weekly Review #35 - Newspaper Feature, Moving, and a Sick Nini</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2023/03/24/weekly_review_20230324/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Mar 2023 11:21:15 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2023/03/24/weekly_review_20230324/</guid><description>&amp;#39;Don&amp;#39;t Stop the Clocks - King Gnu&amp;#39; Preface This piece is a record and reflection of my life from 2023-03-14 to 2023-03-23.
If it weren&amp;rsquo;t for xLog&amp;rsquo;s incentive, I might have skipped this weekly review.
In the past week or so, a series of events unfolded: Nini fell ill, my parents drove to Beijing to pick up the cat (and me), I accompanied them sightseeing (though it was my first time at all the attractions too), met with friends before parting ways, endured a 15-hour cross-city journey, found a new apartment (though it only took an hour to sign the lease), moved and decorated the new place, and started a new job.</description></item><item><title>Weekly Review #34 - Don't Stop the Clocks</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2023/03/13/weekly_review_20230313/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Mar 2023 17:29:49 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2023/03/13/weekly_review_20230313/</guid><description>&amp;#39;Don&amp;#39;t Stop the Clocks - King Gnu&amp;#39; Preface This piece is a record and reflection of my life from 2023-03-08 to 2023-03-13. This week was primarily focused on work handovers, which wasn&amp;rsquo;t as busy as before, but the pressing time and impending tasks still brought considerable pressure. After all, I&amp;rsquo;m about to leave a city I&amp;rsquo;ve lived in for nearly two years. More time was spent on conversations and gatherings,</description></item><item><title>Weekly Review #33 - Beijing x Story x Farewell</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2023/03/07/weekly_review_20230307/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Mar 2023 21:30:42 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2023/03/07/weekly_review_20230307/</guid><description>&amp;#39;クリスマスソング (English Cover) - Matt Cab&amp;#39; Preface This piece is a record and reflection of my life from 2023-02-27 to 2023-03-07.

This week was exceptionally full with work and various personal projects. Although I wasn&amp;rsquo;t truly busy to the point of having no time to sleep, I developed an inexplicable sense of anxiety and low mood, often leading to a tendency for revenge bedtime procrastination.</description></item><item><title>Weekly Review #30 - Open Source Budget, Writing Motivation, and Humility Towards Technology</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2023/02/12/weekly_review_20230212/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Feb 2023 19:41:33 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2023/02/12/weekly_review_20230212/</guid><description>&amp;#39;クリスマスソング (English Cover) - Matt Cab&amp;#39; Preface This is a record and reflection of my life from 2023-02-07 to 2023-02-12.

It&amp;rsquo;s the first week back at work. Since I had been doing some work during the Spring Festival, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t unaccustomed to the work rhythm. However, I often couldn&amp;rsquo;t freely do my own things, which suddenly made me feel pressed for time.
I started revisiting Japanese and was surprised to find that I still remembered a lot.</description></item><item><title>Weekly Review #28 - Mastodon, Hometown, and Hide-and-Seek Cat</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2023/01/31/weekly_review_20230131/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Jan 2023 11:43:38 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2023/01/31/weekly_review_20230131/</guid><description>&amp;#39;Here After Us - Mayday&amp;#39; Preface This is a record and reflection of my life from 2023-01-23 to 2023-01-31.
I spent most of this week in my hometown, making up for some regrets, simple yet precious. After returning to Hangzhou, I stayed an extra day to meet friends, then hurried back to Beijing from Hangzhou. Upon arriving home in Beijing, I immediately went to pick up Nini from my colleague&amp;rsquo;s house after barely putting down my luggage.</description></item><item><title>Weekly Review #27 - What Makes a Home</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2023/01/22/weekly_review_20230122/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Jan 2023 21:39:12 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2023/01/22/weekly_review_20230122/</guid><description>&amp;#39;Here After Us - Mayday&amp;#39; Preface This is a record and reflection of my life from 2023-01-16 to 2023-01-22.
This week, my time was equally divided between Beijing, Hangzhou, and my hometown in Jiangsu, traveling back and forth. For someone who hasn&amp;rsquo;t left home for almost three months, the journey brought some fatigue, but I found that I&amp;rsquo;m not actually averse to such a long-standing change in my life rhythm, and even feel some novelty and anticipation.</description></item><item><title>Weekly Review #26 - Blog, Custom Keyboard and New Server</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2023/01/15/weekly_review_20230115/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jan 2023 19:57:33 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2023/01/15/weekly_review_20230115/</guid><description>&amp;#39;Here After Us - Mayday&amp;#39; Preface This is a record and reflection of my life from January 10, 2023 to January 15, 2023.

This is the first weekly review of 2023. Although the New Year feels like it was just yesterday, the first week of January has already ended. Perhaps my psychological perception of time has become increasingly dull. During the New Year, I wrote a rather detailed annual summary,</description></item><item><title>Photography Collection #01 - Cat In The Box</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2023/01/01/cat_in_the_box/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2023 21:18:03 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2023/01/01/cat_in_the_box/</guid><description>Preface Since November, I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to take proper photos of Nini, but the lighting at home isn&amp;rsquo;t ideal. Due to a busy work schedule, I hadn&amp;rsquo;t deliberately purchased backdrop or lighting equipment. Today, while editing the photos (I mainly just adjust the colors, being lazy), I felt the final images weren&amp;rsquo;t entirely satisfactory. However, I can&amp;rsquo;t abandon my New Year&amp;rsquo;s Day resolution, so I asked a friend to select a few photos that seemed acceptable.</description></item><item><title>Weekly Review #22 - Involution and Anxiety</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2022/12/13/weekly_review_20221213/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Dec 2022 22:24:02 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2022/12/13/weekly_review_20221213/</guid><description>&amp;#39;Here After Us - Mayday&amp;#39; Preface This is a record and reflection of my life from 2022-12-07 to 2022-12-13.
It&amp;rsquo;s been about 20 cumulative days since I last stepped out of my home. Given the current workload of multiple concurrent projects and the almost-cleared negative status, I haven&amp;rsquo;t planned to return to the office yet. I&amp;rsquo;m even considering staying at home until before the new year. The self-quarantine life is quite pleasant.</description></item><item><title>Weekly Review #04 - Vacation, Family Bonds and Sense of Belonging in Cities</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2022/07/24/weekly_review_20220724/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Jul 2022 23:31:27 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2022/07/24/weekly_review_20220724/</guid><description>&amp;#39;Here, After Us - Mayday&amp;#39; Preface This piece is a record and reflection of my life from July 11, 2022 to July 24, 2022. As for the reason for the delay - I was on vacation!!!
Vacation Including my internship, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working for over a year now, but because projects have been ongoing, I&amp;rsquo;ve had hardly any complete holidays except for the Spring Festival, and I&amp;rsquo;ve accumulated quite a few compensatory days off.</description></item></channel></rss>
