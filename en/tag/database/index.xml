using a &amp;ldquo;hash function&amp;rdquo; Good Index Index quality is evaluated by several factors Access types supported by the index efficiently records with a specified value in the attribute (equality query) or records with an attribute value falling in a specified range of values (range query) Access time – query response time Insertion time – data record insertion time Deletion time – data record deletion time Space overhead – size of the index file Classification of Indexes Primary index In a sequentially ordered file, the index whose search key specifies the sequential order of the file Secondary index an index whose search key specifies an order different from the sequential order of the file Also called non-clustered index Dense index Index record appears for every search-key value in the file Sparse Index Contains index records for only some search-key values Applicable when records are sequentially ordered on search-key Less space and less maintenance overhead for insertions and deletions Generally slower than dense index for locating records Good tradeoff: sparse index with an index entry for every block in file, corresponding to least search-key value in the block Primary and Secondary Indices Secondary indices have to be dense Indices offer substantial benefits when searching for records Index is much smaller than relation file (cheap scan) Index can be ordered (fast search) When a file is modified, every index on the file must be updated Updating indices imposes overhead on database modification Indexes should be used with care Sequential scan using primary index is efficient, but a sequential scan using a secondary index is expensive Each record access may fetch a new block from disk Multilevel Index If index does not fit in memory, access becomes expensive To reduce number of disk accesses to index records, treat 1st level of index kept on disk as a sequential file and construct a sparse index on it outer index – a sparse index on 1st-level index file inner index – the 1st-level index file If even outer index is too large to fit in main memory, yet another level of index can be created, and so on B+-Tree Index Files A dynamic, multi-level index Advantage automatically reorganizes itself with small local changes, in the face of insertions and deletions Reorganization of entire file is not required to maintain performance Disadvantage of B+-trees Extra insertion and deletion overhead, space overhead Advantages of B+-trees outweigh disadvantages, and they are used extensively Basic Properties Disk-based tree structure every node of the tree is a block and has an address (block-id) on the disk Multiway tree each node has multiple children (between n/2 and n, where n/2 is the order or degree of the tree) Therefore, at least 50% of the space in a node is guaranteed to be occupied (this rule may not apply to tree root) Balanced tree all paths from the root to a leaf have the same length guarantees good search performance (to be seen later) Disjoint partition of attribute domain into ranges each sub-tree indexes a range in the attribute domain the entries of a directory node define the separators between domain intervals leaf nodes store index entries and pointers to the relation file Non-Leaf Nodes in B+-Trees Each non-leaf node contains up to n-1 search key values and up to n pointers All non-leaf nodes (except root) contain at least n/2 pointers (n/2 is sometimes called the minimum fan-out or degree) Non leaf nodes form a multi-level sparse index on the leaf nodes.</description></item><item><title>COMP7801 Topic 1a Relational Database</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2021/01/23/comp7801_topic1a/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Jan 2021 01:18:17 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2021/01/23/comp7801_topic1a/</guid><description>Relational Databases Structure of Relational Databases Basic structure Given sets D1, D2, &amp;hellip;, Dn A relation r is a subset of D1 x D2 x &amp;hellip;, x Dn A relation is a set of n-tuples (a1, a2, &amp;hellip;, an) where each ai Di Example
