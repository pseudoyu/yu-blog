As an enterprise-grade blockchain system, how does it construct networks based on complex business requirements? What security issues exist during its operation, and how does Fabric preventively address these issues through its mechanisms?
This article will illustrate how a simplified enterprise Fabric network is constructed through examples, and analyze its network and security system.</description></item><item><title>ICOM6045 Topic 1 Cryptography</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2020/10/21/icom6045_topic1/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Oct 2020 19:53:17 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2020/10/21/icom6045_topic1/</guid><description>ICOM6045 Fundamentals of E-Commerce Security Topic 1 Cryptography Definition Process of transforming information to make it unreadable to anyone except those possessing the key Purpose Data confidentiality Transpositions/Permutations An encryption in which the letters of the message are rearranged Function Try to break established patterns Example Columnar transposition Rearrangement of the characters of the plaintext into columns Based on characteristic patterns of pairs of adjacent letters, called digrams Analysis Compute the letter frequencies Break the text into columns by compare a block of ciphertext characters against characters successively farther away in the ciphertext.</description></item></channel></rss>
