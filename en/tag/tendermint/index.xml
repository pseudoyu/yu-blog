As our company&amp;rsquo;s existing solution is based on the Cosmos blockchain, I have spent over a year working on some underlying chain development modifications using the Cosmos SDK. This has given me some understanding of its technical implementation. However, due to the tight development schedule, I never had the opportunity to gain a systematic understanding of Cosmos&amp;rsquo; architectural design and the Tendermint consensus mechanism.</description></item></channel></rss>
