A Good Friend&amp;rsquo;s Wedding I returned to Beijing during the Dragon Boat Festival to attend a wedding - that of my dear high school friend, Jian.
In high school, I was in the liberal arts class with only eight boys. One of them had a sudden epiphany in the second year of high school, deciding to take a break from school to write books and revitalize Chinese literature, leaving only seven of us to accompany each other through the third year.</description></item><item><title>Personal Information Retrieval and Knowledge Management System (Heptabase + Logseq + Readwise)</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2023/09/05/my_personal_pkm_input_output_system/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Sep 2023 02:38:39 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2023/09/05/my_personal_pkm_input_output_system/</guid><description>Preface I seem to have always had a tendency to view myself as a machine, often observing myself from an outsider&amp;rsquo;s perspective, integrating various modules, and constantly tinkering and optimizing. When a certain behavioral pattern or habit I&amp;rsquo;ve built suddenly proves useful at a particular moment, I feel a sense of delight. Conversely, when external influences or my own state disrupt the system, I experience a profound discomfort from the breakdown of order.</description></item><item><title>Weekly Review #45 - Reading Notes, Knowledge Management, and Life in Two Cities</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2023/09/04/weekly_review_20230904/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Sep 2023 00:58:36 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2023/09/04/weekly_review_20230904/</guid><description>&amp;#39;Tenderness - Mayday&amp;#39; Preface This piece is a record and reflection of my life from August 16 to September 4, 2023.
Time has flown by, and two to three weeks have passed unnoticed. I comfort myself by saying that shifting each post forward by a week will soon restore the weekly updates. However, these weeks have not been idle. I&amp;rsquo;ve read some books, perused several articles that greatly impacted me, participated in some interesting activities, tinkered with many intriguing things, rebuilt my knowledge management system, and made orderly progress in both my main work and additional interests.</description></item><item><title>Weekly Review #38 - Foundry Contract Testing, Logseq Task Management, and Surge Ponte Remote Development</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2023/04/30/weekly_review_20230430/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Apr 2023 00:10:03 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2023/04/30/weekly_review_20230430/</guid><description>&amp;#39;Here After Us - Mayday&amp;#39; Preface This piece is a record and reflection of my life from 2023-04-19 to 2023-04-30.
In my previous weekly review, I mentioned a journey across multiple cities. After returning to Hangzhou, I gradually resumed my original life rhythm. I had much more time alone, with plenty of input, reflection, and interesting things to do. However, it seems that I had less time to organize and dialogue with myself, often only realizing the passage of time several days later.</description></item><item><title>Weekly Review #25 - Personal Information Output and Synchronization System Based on Crossbell (Refactored)</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2023/01/09/weekly_review_20230109/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jan 2023 19:12:56 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2023/01/09/weekly_review_20230109/</guid><description>&amp;#39;Here After Us - Mayday&amp;#39; Preface This is a record and reflection of my life from January 1, 2023 to January 9, 2023. This is the first weekly review of 2023. Although the New Year feels like it was just yesterday, the first week of January has already ended. Perhaps my psychological perception of time has become increasingly dull. During the New Year, I wrote a rather detailed annual summary,</description></item><item><title>Personal Toolkit (May 2022)</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2022/05/08/personal_tools_in_2022_may/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 May 2022 15:47:16 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2022/05/08/personal_tools_in_2022_may/</guid><description>&amp;#39;Here After Us - Mayday&amp;#39; Preface I&amp;rsquo;ve always been a tool enthusiast, firmly believing in the principle &amp;ldquo;to do a good job, one must first sharpen one&amp;rsquo;s tools.&amp;rdquo; I constantly tinker with and optimize my hardware and software, seeking the best solution for each specific need. Now, I&amp;rsquo;ve gradually found solutions that best suit my usage habits. Due to work, study, and personal interests, my devices have gone through many iterations.</description></item></channel></rss>
