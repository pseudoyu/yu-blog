As our company&amp;rsquo;s existing solution is based on the Cosmos blockchain, I have spent over a year working on some underlying chain development modifications using the Cosmos SDK. This has given me some understanding of its technical implementation. However, due to the tight development schedule, I never had the opportunity to gain a systematic understanding of Cosmos&amp;rsquo; architectural design and the Tendermint consensus mechanism.</description></item><item><title>Implementing Two-Phase Commit in Solidity Smart Contracts Using State Locks</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2022/07/01/two_phase_commit_contract_practice_in_solidity/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jul 2022 10:54:57 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2022/07/01/two_phase_commit_contract_practice_in_solidity/</guid><description>《后来的我们 - 五月天》 Preface In smart contract applications involving interactions between multiple systems or contracts, particularly in businesses where asset or data accuracy is sensitive, we need to ensure data atomicity throughout the entire business process. Therefore, we need to implement a mechanism similar to multi-phase commit at the contract level, which decomposes the state change process in the contract into two</description></item><item><title>Solidity Smart Contract Development - Using the Hardhat Framework</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2022/06/09/learn_solidity_from_scratch_hardhat/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jun 2022 14:38:10 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2022/06/09/learn_solidity_from_scratch_hardhat/</guid><description>&amp;#39;Here After Us - Mayday&amp;#39; Preface After the previous articles on smart contract basics, Web3.py, and ethers.js, we have mastered the fundamental knowledge of interacting directly with blockchain networks through programs.

In this course, I learned about Ethereum smart contract development and created a simple library management ÐApp. For my graduation project, I chose to develop a music copyright application based on Ethereum, which can be found at Uright - Blockchain Music Copyright Management ÐApp. Through these experiences, I gained a basic understanding of Solidity development.</description></item><item><title>BitXHub Cross-chain Plugin (Fabric) Source Code Analysis</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2021/09/09/blockchain_crosschain_bitxhub/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Sep 2021 15:14:26 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2021/09/09/blockchain_crosschain_bitxhub/</guid><description>Preface I previously mentioned that BitXHub cross-chain platform by QulianTech is a relatively comprehensive open-source cross-chain solution in the industry. It mainly optimizes the functionality, security, and flexibility of the cross-chain process through relay chain, gateway, and plugin mechanisms. Currently, our company&amp;rsquo;s team is working on a cross-chain module for a BaaS platform.

I&amp;rsquo;m quite interested in the architecture and implementation of BaaS platforms. As a platform that provides developers with one-stop creation, management, and maintenance of blockchain applications, what does its architecture look like?
This article is a summary and analysis of the BaaS platform architecture.
Introduction to BaaS Blockchain is a complex distributed system, especially enterprise consortium chain platforms like Hyperledger Fabric, where deployment and operation are extremely intricate.</description></item><item><title>Cross-Chain Technology Principles and Practice</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2021/09/06/blockchain_crosschain/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Sep 2021 15:34:40 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2021/09/06/blockchain_crosschain/</guid><description>Preface Currently, blockchain platforms are becoming increasingly diverse, including established ones like Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum, as well as domestic platforms such as Hyperchain and Z-ledger. As blockchain application ecosystems grow more complex, single-chain performance faces certain bottlenecks. Consequently, collaboration and interaction between chains (information synchronization, sharing, contract interoperability, etc.) have become crucial aspects of chain and application ecosystem development.

Therefore, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to summarize the events supported by Fabric and the listening methods provided by the SDK.
Fabric Events Events are a way for clients to interact with the Fabric network. As shown in the image above, after executing a transaction in the Fabric network, because it is done asynchronously, the client cannot obtain the submitted transaction status (whether it was accepted).</description></item><item><title>Blockchain Network Storage and Optimization Based on CNFS</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2021/08/20/blockchain_paper_cnfs/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Aug 2021 09:30:25 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2021/08/20/blockchain_paper_cnfs/</guid><description>Research on Cloud Computing Processing and Optimization of Distributed Computer Preface After a year of blockchain-related studies at HKU, I developed an interest in the field of distributed storage. My graduation project was also related to IPFS, as detailed in &amp;ldquo;Uright - Blockchain Music Copyright Management ÐApp&amp;rdquo;. Upon returning to the mainland, I had the opportunity to collaborate with Dr. Sun Ye from CNFS Protocol Lab to write this paper, &amp;ldquo;Research on Cloud Computing Processing and Optimization of Distributed Computer (Blockchain Network Storage and Optimization Based on CNFS)&amp;rdquo;, which deepened my understanding of distributed network storage and computing.</description></item><item><title>Detailed Explanation of Ethereum MPT (Merkle Patricia Tries)</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2021/08/16/blockchain_ethereum_mpt/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Aug 2021 12:12:17 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2021/08/16/blockchain_ethereum_mpt/</guid><description>Preface Recently, I received a work assignment to change the data structure of the project&amp;rsquo;s smart contract state tree from a red-black tree to a trie, and to compare the performance of the two data structures. The Trie mainly refers to Ethereum&amp;rsquo;s official Java implementation ethereum/ethereumj, while the red-black tree is implemented by myself. This article is a record of the theoretical and practical comparison of the two data structures.</description></item><item><title>Uright - Blockchain Music Copyright Management ÐApp</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2021/05/10/uright_case_study/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 May 2021 19:30:25 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2021/05/10/uright_case_study/</guid><description>Uright - Blockchain Music Copyright Management ÐApp Introduction A music copyright management Decentralized Application (ÐApp) based on Angular+Solidity+Web3.js, applying technologies such as IPFS, ENS, and Oracles, deployed on Ethereum using Truffle.
The Uright decentralized application allows musicians (content owners) to register their works as &amp;ldquo;Manifestations&amp;rdquo; and record them on the Ethereum blockchain.
&amp;ldquo;Manifestations&amp;rdquo; present musicians&amp;rsquo; works as content fragments to prove authorship and ownership. This is accomplished through the &amp;ldquo;Manifestations&amp;rdquo; smart contract, which records the IPFS hash displaying the work&amp;rsquo;s content, title (planned additional metadata), and registration time.</description></item><item><title>BlockchainGuide - Blockchain Core Knowledge Base</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2021/04/03/blockchain_guide/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Apr 2021 12:12:17 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2021/04/03/blockchain_guide/</guid><description>BlockchainGuide A continuously updated blockchain core knowledge base

I had only a vague understanding of its architecture, the roles of various nodes, and operational mechanisms. Recently, while taking the course &amp;ldquo;FITE3011 Distributed Ledger and Blockchain&amp;rdquo; at HKU, the professor provided a detailed explanation of Hyperledger Fabric&amp;rsquo;s working principles, network setup, and chaincode-related knowledge.</description></item><item><title>Ethereum Core Technology Interpretation</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2021/02/20/blockchain_ethereum_basic/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Feb 2021 12:12:17 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2021/02/20/blockchain_ethereum_basic/</guid><description>Preface Bitcoin, as a decentralized digital currency, has been extremely successful. However, limited by the Bitcoin script (which is not Turing complete and can only handle simple logic), it cannot process very complex business operations. Ethereum introduced smart contracts, allowing the concept of decentralization to be applied to a wider range of application scenarios, thus also being called blockchain 2.0.
