As our company&amp;rsquo;s existing solution is based on the Cosmos blockchain, I have spent over a year working on some underlying chain development modifications using the Cosmos SDK. This has given me some understanding of its technical implementation. However, due to the tight development schedule, I never had the opportunity to gain a systematic understanding of Cosmos&amp;rsquo; architectural design and the Tendermint consensus mechanism.</description></item><item><title>Cross-Chain Technology Principles and Practice</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2021/09/06/blockchain_crosschain/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Sep 2021 15:34:40 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2021/09/06/blockchain_crosschain/</guid><description>Preface Currently, blockchain platforms are becoming increasingly diverse, including established ones like Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum, as well as domestic platforms such as Hyperchain and Z-ledger. As blockchain application ecosystems grow more complex, single-chain performance faces certain bottlenecks. Consequently, collaboration and interaction between chains (information synchronization, sharing, contract interoperability, etc.) have become crucial aspects of chain and application ecosystem development. This article provides an overview of cross-chain technology concepts and</description></item></channel></rss>
