Application Understanding Group related documents for browsing, group genes and proteins that have similar functionality, or group stocks with similar price fluctuations Summarization Reduce size of large data sets Types of Clusterings Partitional Clustering A division data objects into non-overlapping subsets (clusters) such that each data object is in exactly one subset Hierarchical clustering A set of nested clusters organized as a hierarchical tree Other Distinctions Between Sets of Clusters Exclusive versus non-exclusive In non-exclusive clusterings, points may belong to multiple clusters Can represent multiple classes or &amp;lsquo;border&amp;rsquo; points Fuzzy versus non-fuzzy In fuzzy clustering, a point belongs to every cluster with some weight between 0 and 1 Weights must sum to 1 Probabilistic clustering has similar characteristics Partial versus complete In some cases, we only want to cluster some of the data Heterogeneous versus homogeneous Cluster of widely different sizes, shapes, and densities Well-separated clusters A cluster is a set of points such that any point in a cluster is closer (or more similar) to every other point in the cluster than to any point not in the cluster</description></item><item><title>COMP7801 Topic 4 Top-k</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2021/03/06/comp7801_topic4/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Mar 2021 01:18:17 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2021/03/06/comp7801_topic4/</guid><description>Background Multidimensional Data Flat relational tables Multimedia feature vectors Data warehouse data Spatial data Text documents Attribute Types Attributes of multidimensional tuples may have variable types Ordinal (e.g., age, salary) Nominal categorical values (e.g., color, religion) Binary (e.g., gender, owns_property)Basic queries: range, NN, similarity Basic Queries (Range) selection query Returns the records that qualify a (multidimensional) range predicate Example: Return the employees of age between 45 and 50 and salary above $100,000 Distance (similarity) query Returns the records that are within a distance from a reference record.</description></item><item><title>COMP7801 Topic 3 Spatial Networks</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2021/02/27/comp7801_topic3/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Feb 2021 01:18:17 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2021/02/27/comp7801_topic3/</guid><description>Background Network Distance In many real applications accessibility of objects is restricted by a spatial network Examples Driver looking for nearest gas station Mobile user looking for nearest restaurant Shortest path distance used instead of Euclidean distance SP(a,b) = path between a and b with the minimum accumulated length Challenges Euclidean distance is no longer relevant R-tree may not be useful, when search is based on shortest path distance Graph cannot be flattened to a one-dimensional space Special storage and indexing techniques for graphs are required Graph properties may vary directed vs.</description></item><item><title>COMP7103 Topic 2 Association Rules</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2021/02/25/comp7103_topic2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Feb 2021 01:18:17 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2021/02/25/comp7103_topic2/</guid><description>COMP7103 Data Mining Topic 2 Association Rules Market-Basket Model A general many-many mapping (association) between two kinds of things
