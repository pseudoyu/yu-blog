Given the current workload of multiple concurrent projects and the almost-cleared negative status, I haven&amp;rsquo;t planned to return to the office yet.

The self-quarantine life is quite pleasant.</description></item><item><title>Weekly Review #21 - Life Picked Up Again</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2022/12/06/weekly_review_20221206/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Dec 2022 21:48:50 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2022/12/06/weekly_review_20221206/</guid><description>&amp;#39;Here After Us - Mayday&amp;#39; Preface This is a record and reflection of my life from 2022-11-28 to 2022-12-06.

The weekend has arrived, and for once, I had no concentrated development work. I slept soundly, caught up on some missed episodes in the afternoon, and finally began writing my weekly review.
