Application Understanding Group related documents for browsing, group genes and proteins that have similar functionality, or group stocks with similar price fluctuations Summarization Reduce size of large data sets Types of Clusterings Partitional Clustering A division data objects into non-overlapping subsets (clusters) such that each data object is in exactly one subset Hierarchical clustering A set of nested clusters organized as a hierarchical tree Other Distinctions Between Sets of Clusters Exclusive versus non-exclusive In non-exclusive clusterings, points may belong to multiple clusters Can represent multiple classes or &amp;lsquo;border&amp;rsquo; points Fuzzy versus non-fuzzy In fuzzy clustering, a point belongs to every cluster with some weight between 0 and 1 Weights must sum to 1 Probabilistic clustering has similar characteristics Partial versus complete In some cases, we only want to cluster some of the data Heterogeneous versus homogeneous Cluster of widely different sizes, shapes, and densities Well-separated clusters A cluster is a set of points such that any point in a cluster is closer (or more similar) to every other point in the cluster than to any point not in the cluster</description></item><item><title>COMP7103 Topic 2 Association Rules</title><link>https://www.pseudoyu.com/zh/2021/02/25/comp7103_topic2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Feb 2021 01:18:17 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.pseudoyu.com/zh/2021/02/25/comp7103_topic2/</guid><description>COMP7103 Data Mining Topic 2 Association Rules Market-Basket Model A general many-many mapping (association) between two kinds of things

A decision-support system (DSS) is a system that assists decision makers to make important decisions for an organization or business KDD and data mining are important components in many DSS&amp;rsquo;s Data and Knowledge
Data A collecion of facts about certain group of objects Pattern Certain characteristics of data that are frequently observed Knowledge Some general rules about the objects Data Warehouse</description></item></channel></rss>
