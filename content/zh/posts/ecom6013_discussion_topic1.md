## Discussion Topic #1 Why did Puma build a single centralized website rather than continue with multiple websites serving different countries and regions

Puma has been developing for more than 70 years. It’s one of the largest sportswear manufacturers in the world. How to manage such a large scale business and tremendous amount of data has become a major challenge in its development.

Puma used to deploy multiple websites to present its information according the functions or the locations, which brings several problems. When the company needs to update new products or services, the relevant staffs needs to update all the information on different platform, which is time-costing and unnecessary. Not only should puma hire more staffs to handle these tedious work, but it also increase the risks of making mistakes. In addition, too many different websites especially in different layouts or style will confuse customers, causing negative impacts on forming the brand.

Firstly, one of the most important benefits brought out by a single centralized website is a consistent brand image. Consistent styles of all platform will bring customers better visual experience and strengthen their impression about the company. Secondly, one integrated website can divide different functions or parts into various category using Content management System (CMS) instead of running different websites at the same time. It's more convenient for company to manage and for customers to get the target products or services. Besides, using responsive design technology will increase the flexibility of the website on different platforms such as laptops, tablets and smartphones. Also, language translation tools can be integrated into the website so as to help potential users can get the information. What's more, company can better collect data from this centralized website system. Using these data Puma can perform better in understanding the clients - their capabilities, desires and so on.
