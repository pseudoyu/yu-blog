* IC: a set of electronic circuits on a small flat piece ("chip") of semiconductor. Makes extensive use of transistors.

*Electronic circuit: Processing (Computing), DC*

*Electrical circuit: Powering, AC*

**Integrated Circuit**
* General purpose, microprocessors from Intel
* Application-specific, or ASIC, [Apple-designed Processors](https://www.apple.com/hk/en/newsroom/2020/06/apple-announces-mac-transition-to-apple-silicon/)

**To Make an IC**
* Design
* Fabrication (fabrication plants/factories, "foundries" or "fabs")
