* Everyone can obtain and run a Bitcoin client

**Bitcoin addresses**
* An elliptic curve public key
  * 25-44 characters for users
* Send Bitcoins
  * Receiving address (public)
  * Amount
* Receive Bitcoins
  * Receiving address (public)
* Addresses are not directly registered to users

* Bank robbery by hackers
* Malware attacks against wallets

* Scalability
* Time to solve a block (security concerns in algorithms)
* Energy consumption
* Meaningless and highly inefficient
