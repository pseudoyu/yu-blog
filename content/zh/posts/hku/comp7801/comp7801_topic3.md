### Background

#### Network Distance

* In many real applications accessibility of objects is restricted by a spatial network
    * Examples
        * Driver looking for nearest gas station
        * Mobile user looking for nearest restaurant
* **Shortest path distance** used instead of Euclidean distance
* SP(a,b) = path between a and b with the minimum accumulated length

#### Challenges

* Euclidean distance is no longer relevant
    * R-tree may not be useful, when search is based on shortest path distance
* Graph cannot be flattened to a one-dimensional space
    * Special storage and indexing techniques for graphs are required
* Graph properties may vary
    * directed vs. undirected
    * length, time, etc. as edge weights

### Modeling and Storing Spatial Networks

#### Modeling Spatial Networks

* Adjacency matrix only appropriate for dense graphs
* Spatial networks are sparse: use adjacency lists instead

![Modeling_Spatial_Networks](https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/Modeling_Spatial_Networks.png)

#### Storing Large Spatial Networks

* Problem: adjacency lists representation may not fit in memory if graph is large
* Solution:
    * partition adjacency lists to disk blocks (based on proximity)
    * create B+-tree index on top of partitions (based on node-id)

### Shortest Path Search

* Given a graph G(V,E), and two nodes s,t in V, find the shortest path from s to t
* A classic algorithmic problem
* Studied extensively since the 1950’s
* Several methods:
  * Dijkstra’s algorithm
  * A*-search
  * Bi-directional search

#### Dijkstra’s Shortest Path Search

* idea: incrementally explore the graph around s, visitingnodes in distance order to suntil t is found (like NN)

![Dijkstra_2](https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/Dijkstra_2.png)

#### Algorithm

![Dijkstra_Algorithm](https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/Dijkstra_Algorithm.png)

#### Example

![Dijkstra_Example](https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/Dijkstra_Example.png)

#### Illustrating

* Find the shortest path between a and b.
* Worst-case performance O(|E| + |V|log|V| )

### A*-search

#### Description

* Dijkstra’s search explores nodes around s without a specific search direction until t is found

* Idea: improve Dijkstra’s algorithm by directing search towards t

* Due to triangular inequality, Euclidean distance is a lower bound of network distance

* Use Euclidean distance to lower bound network distance based on known information:

    * Nodes are visited in increasing SPD(s,v)+dist(v,t) order
        * SPD(s,v): shortest path distance from s to v (computed by Dijkstra)
        * dist(v,t): Euclidean distance between v and t
    * Original Dijkstra visits nodes in increasing SPD(s,v) order

![A_Star_1](https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/A_Star_1.png)

#### Example

![A_Star_Example](https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/A_Star_Example.png)

#### Illustrating

* Find the shortest path between s and t.
    * f(p) = Dijkstra_dist(s, p) + Euclidean_dist(p, t)

### Bi-directional search

* Dijkstra’s search explores nodes around s without a specific search direction until t is found
* Idea: search can be performed concurrently from s and from t (backwards)
* The shortest path tree of s and the (backward) shortest path tree of t are computed in concurrently
    * One queue Q_s for forward and one queue Q_t for backward search
    * Node visits are prioritized based on min(SPD(s,v), SPD(v,t))
    * If v already visited from s and v is in Qt, then candidate shortest path: p(s,v)+p(v,t)  (if v already visited from t and v in Q_s symmetric)
    * If v is visited by both s and t terminate search; report best candidate shortest path

#### Example

![Bi_Directional_Example](https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/Bi_Directional_Example.png)

### Discussions

* A* and bi-directional search can be combined to powerful search techniques
* A* can only be applied if lower distance bounds are available
* All versions of Dijkstra’s search require non-negative edge weights
    * Bellman-Ford is an algorithm for arbitrary negative edges

## Spatial queries over spatial networks

### Introduction

#### Source/Destination on Edges

* We have assumed that points s and t are nodes of the network
* In practice s and t could be arbitrary points on edges
    * Mobile user locations
* Solve problem by introducing 2 more nodes

![Source_Destination_on_Edges](https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/Source_Destination_on_Edges.png)

#### Spatial Queries over Spatial Networks

* Data:
    * A (static) spatial network (e.g., city map)
    * A (dynamic) set of spatial objects
* Spatial queries based on network distance:
    * Selections. Ex: find gas stations within 10km driving distance from here
    * Nearest neighbor search. Ex: find k nearest restaurants from present position
    * Joins. Ex: find pairs of restaurants and hotels at most 100m from each other

![Spatial_Queries_over_Spatial_Networks](https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/Spatial_Queries_over_Spatial_Networks.png)

#### Methodology

* Store (and index) the spatial network
    * Graph component (indexes connectivity information)
    * Spatial component (indexes coordinates of nodes, edges, etc.)
* Store (and index) the sets of spatial objects
    * Ex., one spatial relation for restaurants, one spatial relation for hotels, one relation for mobile users, etc.
* Given a spatial location p, use spatial component of network to find the network edge containing p
* Given a network edge, use network component to traverse neighboring edges
* Given a neighboring edge, use spatial indexes to find objects on them

### Evaluation of Spatial Selections (1)

* Query: find all objects in spatial relation R, within network distance ε from location q
* Method:
    * Use spatial index of network (R-tree indexing network edges) to find edge n_1n_2, which includes q
    * Use adjacency index of network (graph component) and apply Dijkstra’s algorithm to progressively retrieve edges that are within network distance ε from location q
    * For all these edges apply a spatial selection on the R-tree that indexes R to find the results

#### Example

* Example: Find restaurants at most distance 10 from q

* Step 1: find network edge which contains q

![Evaluation_of_Spatial_Selections_1](https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/Evaluation_of_Spatial_Selections_1.png)

* Step 2: traverse network to find all edges (or parts of them within distance 10 from q)

![Evaluation_of_Spatial_Selections_2](https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/Evaluation_of_Spatial_Selections_2.png)

* Step 3: find restaurants that intersect the subnetwork computed at step 2

![Evaluation_of_Spatial_Selections_3](https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/Evaluation_of_Spatial_Selections_3.png)

### Evaluation of Spatial Selections (2)

#### Description

* Query: find all objects in spatial relation R, within network distance ε from location q
* Alternative method based on Euclidean bounds:
    * Assumption: Euclidean distance is a lower-bound of network distance:
        * dist(v,u) ≤ SPD(v,u), for any v,u
    * Use R-tree on R to find set S of objects such that for each o in S: dist(q,o) ≤ ε
    * For each o in S:
        * find where o is located in the network (use Network R-tree)
        * compute SPD(q,o) (e.g. use A*)
        * If SPD(q,o) ≤ ε then output o

#### Example
* Example: Find restaurants at most distance 10 from q

* Step 1: find restaurants for which the Euclidean distance to q is at most 10: S={r1,r2,r3}

![Evaluation_of_Spatial_Selections_Example_1](https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/Evaluation_of_Spatial_Selections_Example_1.png)

* Step 2: for each restaurant in S, compute SPD to q and verify if it is indeed a correct result

![Evaluation_of_Spatial_Selections_Example_2](https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/Evaluation_of_Spatial_Selections_Example_2.png)

### Evaluation of NN search (1)

* Query: find in spatial relation R the nearest object to a given location q
* Method:
    * Use spatial index of network (R-tree indexing network edges) to find edge n_1n_2, which includes q
    * Use adjacency index of network (graph component) and apply Dijkstra’s algorithm to progressively retrieve edges in order of their distance to q
    * For each edge apply a spatial selection on the R-tree that indexes R to find any objects
    * Keep track of nearest object found so far; use its shortest path distance to terminate network browsing

#### Example
* Example: Find nearest restaurant to q
* Step: in ppt 31

### Evaluation of NN search (2)

* Query: find in spatial relation R the nearest object to a given location q
* Alternative method based on Euclidean bounds:
    * Assumption: Euclidean distance lower-bounds network distance:
        * dist(v,u) ≤ SPD(v,u), for any v,u

![Evaluation_of_NN_search](https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/Evaluation_of_NN_search.png)

### Spatial Join Queries

#### Description

* Query: find pairs (r,s), such that r in relation R, s in relation S, and SPD(r,s)≤ε
* Methods:
    * For each r in R, do an ε-distance selection queries for objects in S (Index Nested Loops)
    * For each pair (r,s), such that Euclidean dist(r,s)≤ε compute SPD(r,s) and verify SPD(r,s)≤ε

### Notes on Query Evaluation based on Network Distance

* For each query type, there are methods based on network browsing and methods based on Euclidean bounds
* Network browsing methods are fast if network edges are densely populated with points of interest
    * A limited network traversal can find the result fast
* Methods based on Euclidean bounds are good if the searched POIs are sparsely distributed in the network
    * Few verifications with exact SP searches are required
    * Directed SP search (e.g. using A*) avoids visiting empty parts of the network

## Advanced indexing techniques for spatial networks

### Shortest Path Materialization and Indexing in Large Graphs

* Dijkstra’s algorithm and related methods could be very expensive on very large graphs
* (Partial) materialization of shortest paths in static graphs can accelerate search

![Shortest_Path_Materialization_and_Indexing_in_Large_Graphs.png](https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/Shortest_Path_Materialization_and_Indexing_in_Large_Graphs.png)

### Hierarchical Path Materialization

* Idea: Partition graph G into G_1,G_2,G_3,... based on connectivity and proximity of nodes
* Every edge of G goes to exactly one G_i
* Border nodes belong to more than one G_i’s
* For each G_i compute and materialize SPs between every pair of nodes in G_i (matrix M_i)
    * Partitions are small enough for materialization space overhead to be low
* Compute and materialize SPs between every pair of border nodes (matrix B)
    * If border nodes too many, hierarchically partition them into 2nd-level partitions

![Hierarchical_Path_Materialization](https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/Hierarchical_Path_Materialization.png)

#### algorithm

![Hierarchical_Path_Materialization_algorithm](https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/Hierarchical_Path_Materialization_algorithm.png)

#### Illustrating

* Good partitioning if:
    * small partitions
    * few combinations examined for SP search
* Real road networks:
    * Non-highway nodes in local partitions
    * Highway nodes become border nodes

![Hierarchical_Path_Materialization_Illustration](https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/Hierarchical_Path_Materialization_Illustration.png)

### Compressing Materialized Paths

* Distance matrix with successors has O(n_2) space cost
* Motivation: reduce space by grouping targets based on common successors

![Compressing_Materialized_Paths](https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/Compressing_Materialized_Paths.png)

#### algorithm

* Create and encode one space partitioning defined by targets of the same successor
* For each node s, index Is a set of <succ,R> pairs:
    * succ: a successor of s
    * R: a continuous region, such that for each t in R, the successor of s in SP(s,t) is succ

![Compressing_Materialized_Paths_Algorithm](https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/Compressing_Materialized_Paths_Algorithm.png)

* To compute SP(s,t) for a given s, t:
    1. SP=s
    2. Use spatial index Is to find <succ,R>, such that t in R
    3. SP = SP + (s,succ)
    4. If succ = t, report SP and terminate
    5. Otherwise s=succ; Goto step 2
