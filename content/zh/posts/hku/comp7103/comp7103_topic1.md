# COMP7103 Data Mining

## Topic 1 Introduction

**Decision-Support System (DSS)**
* A decision-support system (DSS) is a system that assists decision makers to make important decisions for an organization or business
* KDD and data mining are important components in many DSS's

**Data and Knowledge**
* Data
  * A collecion of facts about certain group of objects
* Pattern
  * Certain characteristics of data that are frequently observed
* Knowledge
  * Some general rules about the objects

**Data Warehouse**
* An integration of various departmental databases (organization-wide data)
* Avoids overloading local operational databases
* A convenient place where KDD and data mining applications are performed
* Provide data mining algorithms an easy access to the required data
* Wrappers
  * Extract
  * Transform
* Can also be used to support other DSS tools, e.g. On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) - analyze large amount of data, Online Transaction Processing (OLTP)

**Data Mining and KDD**
* KDD (Knowledge Discovery in Databases)
  * A process of discovering useful knowledge from big collection of data
* Data Mining
  * A step within the KDD process in which interesting patterns are found. Some of these patterns are then interpreted and transformed into useful knowledge.

*Data Mining is a step in the whole KDD process*

*KDD is a process of identifying patterns in data and deriving knowledge from them*

* valid
* novel
* potentially useful
* understandable

**Data Mining**

**Databases**
* Bottom layer of the architecture
* Contains data sources (raw data)

*Traditional Database usually only provides the functions of storing and retrieving facts*

*The knowledge resulting from data mining should carry certain degree of predictive ability or descriptive (explanatory) ability (or both)*

**Data Mining Engine**
* Applies data mining algorithms on data
* Provides multiple functionality

**Evaluation Module**
* Allow users to specify what is/isn't interesting

**Knowledge Base**
* Capture domain specific knowledge
* Stores the rules generated by data mining

**Graphical User Interface**
* Presents mined patterns and rules to users in an easy-to-visualize way
* Provides feedback mechanisms for the users to specify the criteria of interestingness
* Provides a query language or query interface for users to select and retrieve

**Challenges of Data Mining**
* Technical
  * Scalability
  * Dimensionality
  * Data stream
* Data
  * Complex and heterogeneous data
  * Data quality
* Privacy
  * Data ownership and distribution
  * Privacy preservation
* Results
  * Interpretation of patterns

**The KDD Process**

![kdd_process](https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/kdd_process.png)

* Step 1: Goal Setting
  * Understand your application domain
  * Obtain prior known knowledge
* Step 2: Data Collection
  * Characteristics
  * Where to find
  * How to store
* Step 3: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
  * Missing data
  * Incorrect data (noise)
  * Outliers
* Step 4: Data Reduction and Transformation (or Preparation)
  * Compact data into a form
  * Improve data mining algorithms
* Step 5: Data Mining
  * Pick a data mining model
  * Pick a data mining algorithm
  * Apply the algorithm to the data
* Step 6: Result Evaluation
  * Check the results and goals
  * Refine and re-run (if not)
* Step 7: Knowledge Consolidation
  * Document
  * Report

**Iterative and Interactive**
* Some steps of the process need to be refined, and the whole process be repeated
* Certain amount of human involvement is needed to monitor and to fine tune the steps

**Prediction**
* Uses database records that describe information about past behavior to automatically generate a model (or rule) that can predict future behavior

**Description**
* Derive patterns that summarize the underlying relationships in data and to describe the characteristics of data

**OLAP (On-Line Analytical Processing)**
* View data in a multi-dimensional model (a data cube)
* Fast aggregation
* Summarization

*Example*
* Selection -> Group-by -> Summarization

**Classification**

*Supervised learning*

* Goal
  * Unseen records should be assigned a class (accuracy)
* Approach
  * Given a training set
  * Learn classifier
  * Find a model
  * Test the model using test set

*Example*
* Direct Marketing
  * Reduce cost of mailing by targeting a set of consumers likely to buy a new cell-phone product

**Regression**
* Goal
  * Preduct a value of numerical variable based on the values of other variables

*Example*
* Predicting sales amounts of new product based on advertising expenditure
* Predicting wind velocities as a function of temperature, humidity, air pressure, etc.

**Clustering**
* Given a set of data objects with a set of attributes and similarity measure
* Find clusters (e.g. distance-based clustering)
  * Maximize the intra-cluster similarity
  * Minimize the inter-cluster similarity
* Objects in one cluster are more similiar to one another

![illustrating_cluster](https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/illustrating_cluster.png)

*Example*
* Document Clustering
  * To find groups of documents that are similar to each other based on the important terms they contain

**Association Rule Discovery**
* Given a set of records each of which contains some items from a given collection
* Goal
  * Produce dependency rules which predict occurrence of an item based on occurrences of other items

*Example*
* Marketing and Sales Promotion

**Sequence Analysis**
* Given a sequence database contains sequences of events
* Find sequences
  * Interesting
  * Frequently occurring
* Predict future behavior.

*Example*
* Renting movies
* Buying habits
* Web serving behavior
* Web log analysis
