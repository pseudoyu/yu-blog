# COMP7404 Computational Intelligence and Machine Learning

## Topic 3 Adversarial Search

**A Multi-agent Competitive Environment**
* Other agents are planning against us
* Goals are in conflict (not necessarily)

**Game Definition**
* A game can be defined as
  * s : States
  * s0: Initial state
  * Player(s) : Defines which player has the move
  * Actions(s) : Returns a set of legal moves
  * Result(s,a) : Defines the result of a move
  * TerminalTest(s) : True when game is over, false otherwise
  * Utility(s,p) : Defines the final numeric value for a game that ends in terminal state s for player p
* A game tree can be constructed
  * Nodes are game states and edges are moves

**Tic-Tac-Toe Game Tree**

**Minimax Search**
* A state-space search tree
* Players alternate turns
* Compute each node‚Äôs minimax value
  * the best achievable utility against a rational (optimal) adversary
  * ![minimax](https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/minimax.png)
* Will lead to optimal strategy
  * Best achievable payoff against best play
* Example
  * ![minimax_example](https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/minimax_example.png)
* Implementation
  * ![minimax_implementation](https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/minimax_implementation.png)
* Properties
  * Complete - Yes, if tree is finite
  * Optimal - In general no, yes against an optimal opponent
  * Time complexity - O(b^m)
  * Space complexity - O(bm)

**Depth-Limit Search (DLS)**
* A depth limit search (DLS)
  * Search only to a limited depth in the tree
  * Replace terminal utilities with an evaluation function for non-terminal positions
* Problems
  * Guarantee of optimal play is gone
  * Need to design evaluation function
* An evaluation function
  * An evaluation function Eval(s) scores non-terminals in depth-limited search
    * An estimate of the expected utility of the game from a given position
  * Ideal function
    * The actual minimax value of the position
  * The performance of a game-playing program depends strongly on the quality of its evaluation functio

**ùõº-ùõΩ Pruning Algorithm**

![pruning_algorithm](https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/pruning_algorithm.png)

* Min version
  * Consider Min‚Äôs value at some node n
  * n will decrease (or stay constant) while the descendants of n are examined
  * Let m be the best value that Max can get at any choice point along the current path from the root
  * If n becomes worse (<) than m
    * Max will avoid it
    * Stop considering n‚Äôs other children
* Max version is symmetric
* Properties
  * Pruning has no effect on the minimax value at the root
  * Values of intermediate nodes might be wrong
    * Action selection not appropriate for this simple version of alpha-beta pruning
* Move ordering
  * The effectiveness of alpha-beta pruning is highly dependent on the order in which states are examined
  * It is worthwhile to try to examine first the successors that are likely best
    * Examine only O(b^(m/2)) nodes to pick the best move, instead of O(bm) for minimax

**Expectimax Search**

![expectimax_search](https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/expectimax_search.png)

* Values reflect average case outcomes, not worst case outcomes
* Expectimax search computes the expected score under optimal play
  * Max nodes as in minimax search
  * Chance nodes are like min nodes but the outcome is uncertain
  * Calculate their expected utilities
    * i.e., take weighted average of children
* Expectiminimax
  * Environment is an extra "random agent" player that moves after each min/max agent

**Multi-Agent Utilities**

![multi_agent](https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/multi_agent.png)

* Generalisation of minimax
  * Terminals and nodes have utility vectors
  * Each player maximizes its own component
  * Gives rise to cooperation and competition dynamically
