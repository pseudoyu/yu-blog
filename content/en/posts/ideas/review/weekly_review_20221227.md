## Preface

This piece is a record and reflection of my life from December 20, 2022 to December 27, 2022.

Unconsciously, this is already the 24th article, and the last weekly report of 2022. Sometimes there's this inexplicable sense of ceremony when meaningful events occur at rather round time points, which often makes one particularly happy.

Sometimes the desire to share is just so wondrous. Although I had grown accustomed to closing my Moments entry for nearly four or five years and rarely posted anything related to personal emotions, in the past half year, I began to record my daily life through weekly reports and frequently share on Twitter and Instagram (although mostly cat-related, it's still the first step in recovering from social phobia). Sometimes change doesn't need too many reasons to occur, it's just about timing.

This week I was still shuttling between learning and working, but perhaps due to severe lack of sleep in the previous few days (basically sleeping after 3 AM), efficiency wasn't very high. Most of the time was spent watching courses and debugging code, which also allowed me to slowly adjust my pace.

I spent my first Christmas at home with my cat. I received Christmas decorations for Nini sent by a friend but was too lazy to take photos on the day. I'll release them together with the year-end photos (still on the SD card). On that day, I also ordered Fat Brother's Crab Pot takeout, which I had been missing for quite a while, as a bit of a ritual. But perhaps due to long-term fasting and eating only one meal a day, my appetite has decreased severely, and I couldn't finish it even in two meals.

A college classmate whom I hadn't contacted for a long time recently became a streamer on Bilibili. Suddenly, I felt my otaku attributes were awakened. I watched a few streams and was entrusted to be a righteous room manager and information teacher (?) in the fan group, which was quite interesting. By the way, I researched the recording tool and found a server to run a Docker service for automatic screen recording. It feels quite fun to be able to solve friends' problems with some familiar technologies.

Also, it's snowing on my blog.

## Love Actually

Although it's hard for me to contemplate how much longing and courage I still have for love, with the person I once thought I could spend the rest of my life with quietly leaving, traces of life being erased bit by bit, it's inevitable to doubt whether True Love exists when memories resurface. So on Christmas night, I revisited the classic "Love Actually", which is also an annual tradition.

This is a movie that always makes me willing to continue believing in beauty no matter how painful a moment I'm in. This movie and Matt Cab's English cover of "Christmas Song" (theme song of the Japanese drama "From Five to Nine") always connect Christmas with beautiful love for me. It's not about specific emotions or experiences, just this beautiful atmosphere is enough to express all sentiments.

My favorite is this couple. Although there's only love hidden in the heart, it's sincere and beautiful.

"I love you, it has nothing to do with you."

It's quite rare (or perhaps childish) to retain so many fantasies at this age, but I always feel that the sentiment of liking is far above other factors. I still insist on this after all these experiences.

As I write, I can't help but feel some emotions. I don't want to talk too much, so I'll share some lyrics.

## Daily Life with "Nini"

The previous batch of photos and Christmas ones haven't been developed yet, so I'll just share some quiet daily moments.

## Others

This section will record some of my input and output, as well as other things I find interesting.

### Output

In last week's report, I wrote an article about how to learn, which is a summary and reflection of some of my experiences. I'm quite happy about it, and I also posted it on Sspai. I'll continue to work several jobs to earn cat food money, haha.

Although I don't want to start setting various New Year's resolutions so early, I need to continue updating articles!

### Input

#### Anime

- **Heaven Official's Blessing**, this one is quite interesting. I rarely watch Chinese animation and similar subjects, but my sister, who just started junior high school this year, began writing fan fiction for Heaven Official's Blessing. Although I've finished watching each episode, I haven't watched the animation yet. It's also interesting to understand my sister's preferences and the world she focuses on in this way.
- **Death Note: Desu n√¥to**, the Death Note anime is unbeatable, but I just like it so much that I'll watch various derivative works even if I might be disappointed. But the series is surprisingly good, focusing a lot on Light's psychological portrayal and changes.
- **Spy x Family**, I didn't follow part 2 when it started airing, and only caught up these days. Anya is the best!
- **The Three-Body Problem**, the fourth episode was a bit confusing, stretching a plot that could be told in a few sentences into an entire episode.
