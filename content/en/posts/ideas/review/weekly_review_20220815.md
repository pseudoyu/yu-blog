## Preface

This is a record and reflection of my life from `2022-08-08` to `2022-08-15`. This week's work still revolved around preparing for an evaluation of the project, mainly focusing on explaining the proposal. Work hours were relatively normal, and I gradually regained a good life rhythm.

However, I felt that after getting used to staying at home after work, I lacked the motivation to go out. The planned skateboarding practice and night runs were put on hold. Compared to before, I did go out a few times - dinner gatherings on some weekday evenings, a trip to Nanluoguxiang on the weekend, and an evening stroll at Shichahai. I've always thought this place name was beautiful, and finally got to see it.

After last week's adjustment, I scheduled quite a few learning plans this week and decided to validate my learning by taking a certification exam, which is also a form of external motivation. Besides that, I chatted with a few friends about work adjustments, remote work, and career pursuits.

## Learning and Certification

In my previous two work projects, I frequently used Docker and Kubernetes, and I'm quite familiar with their basic commands and configuration file writing. However, I never had a systematic study of their architecture and technical details. Last week, I watched some explanations on the YouTube channel "[TechWorld with Nana](https://www.techworld-with-nana.com)", which filled in many knowledge gaps.

But because Kubernetes involves so many components and operations, it's easy to forget if not used for a while, and it's not conducive to memory without hands-on practice. Moreover, I'm very interested in the DevOps field and often tinker with some automation tools and serverless applications. So I decided to study more systematically and take the Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD) certification, a certification project jointly developed by CNCF and the Linux Foundation. This project is mainly aimed at developers and covers many knowledge points:

What's special is that this certification exam ends with 19 hands-on practical questions, and you can also check the official Kubernetes documentation. There's nothing that needs to be memorized by rote, which is very suitable for testing learning outcomes. I bought the "[Kubernetes Certified Application Developer (CKAD) with Tests](https://www.udemy.com/course/certified-kubernetes-application-developer/)" course on the Udemy platform, and I've been immersed in doing the Labs it comes with recently. Because it's an online environment, it's very convenient, reminiscent of the feeling of rushing to finish assignments before deadlines back in school.

Actually, I seemed to have taken quite a few certifications in college. One that left a deep impression was an intermediate software qualification (Software Designer) certificate. Because it had a theoretical comprehensive exam in the morning and a practical exam in the afternoon, with a pass rate of less than 30%, I was very nervous when I first registered. I bought books and various materials early on, but I kept procrastinating until only half a month was left before I started urgent revision and practice questions, finally passing with a borderline score. Because I wasn't majoring in CS in college, the deepest experience from that exam was gaining a systematic understanding of software engineering, operating systems, computer organization principles, and various programming languages during the preparation process, which provided a lot of help for my later cross-disciplinary studies.

Later, because my undergraduate major was English, I also took TEM-4, TEM-8, IELTS, etc. I increasingly realized the importance of learning goals and plans for understanding a new field or mastering new knowledge. Similar to the previously mentioned mode of learning oriented towards weekly reviews or blogs, having an output standard makes the learning process more systematic and the thought process clearer. The most recent ones should be CKAD and Japanese N2. I can explore others further (though some certifications are really expensive).

## Work and State Adjustment

This week, I chatted with two friends about work-related matters. One is changing jobs and came to learn about some web3-related information. The other has been working in a web3 team for the past few months. I interviewed them about their thoughts on work, which I found very enviable and interesting:

> "You can meet more passionate/interesting people"

> "I don't take naps anymore, I'm more willing to do my work well, it doesn't even feel like work"

> "It emphasizes initiative, while also being challenging"

> "Fewer meetings, more freedom, sometimes I write code until one or two in the morning without realizing it, a long-lost feeling"

You can feel their passion and expectations between the lines. Besides being a tool for making a living, they have their own pursuits and ideas about the work atmosphere, mode, and content, which has greatly influenced my definition and standards for future work.

My learning and work state have improved in the past few days, but sleep is still somewhat problematic. I often have intermittent dreams, mixed with many past memories, so real that it's hard to recover even after waking up. It's time to start booking for the physical examination, I want to complete it in August.

## Miscellaneous

This section will record some of my input and output, as well as other things I find interesting.

### Learning

As mentioned above, this week was mainly about learning DevOps and preparing for CKAD. At the same time, I did some learning and recording on automatic deployment and operation and maintenance tools such as GitLab CI/CD, GitHub Action, Ansible, etc., which are still being organized.

In addition, I picked up photo editing (Adobe Photoshop + Affinity Photo) and video editing (Final Cut Pro X + Davinci Resolve) skills again, and started to slowly re-plan some of my life records.

### Blog Related

After keeping my Sspai editor waiting for more than a month (and leaving messages on read), I finally had a pang of conscience and finished the draft of the previously commissioned article about Stablecoin and sent it over. After some revisions and additions based on feedback, it will be ready. I feel like a huge weight has been lifted off my chest.

The article I wrote before, "[Thin Client Development Workflow Based on frp Intranet Penetration](https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2022/07/05/access_your_local_devices_using_reverse_proxy_tool_frp/)", was finally published this week and included in the [member-exclusive](https://sspai.com/prime/story/thin-client-solution-with-frp) content, which is a small achievement.

The remaining plan is to complete the following blog posts this week (maybe more notes on practice):

1. Cosmos Principles and Architecture
2. Docker Basics and Practice
3. Kubernetes Basics and Practice

### Input

#### Books

- **Tim Cook: The Genius Who Took Apple to the Next Level**, almost finished, feeling a deeper understanding of the philosophy behind Apple products

#### TV Series

- **Extraordinary Attorney Woo**, it's starting to get emotional, with some plot conflicts emerging, and the little whale is really cute
- **Stone and Cocco: Is it Okay to File a Case Like This?**, a new Japanese drama, also in the legal genre. Actually, I'm not very impressed with the male lead's character setting, but because the female lead is Kasumi Arimura, there's a reason to watch

#### Movies

- **Decision to Leave**, the cinematography and overall rhythm are very comfortable. The description of crime and psychology occupies the vast majority, but there's a lack of presentation in plot development and mental changes. The fun part is finding various uses of Apple devices in it

#### Anime

- **Summer Time Rendering**, continuing to wait for the development of the later plot
- **My Stepmom's Daughter is My Ex**, I quite like this kind of romance anime
