## Preface

It has been over a year since I came to Beijing. Due to long periods of staying in my small room and lacking the mood to explore, its four seasons have merely been the changing greenery on my way to work. I haven't even visited the most well-known landmarks.

In fact, I've moved between quite a few cities over the years. Each time, I always thought, "There's still time," "There are plenty of days ahead," "There will always be a chance," yet often left with many regrets. It wasn't until nearly December that I realized it was already late autumn, and the red leaves of Xiangshan I had planned to see might only have remnants left. Nevertheless, I decided to capture some traces of autumn through my lens.

I had previously read Lin Yutang's "Moment In Peking," which carries many joys and sorrows of this city and sketched my first impression of Beijing. So I named this photography collection "Moment In Peking (The Autumn)." Although the autumn spirit has almost dissipated, it remains a piece of city memory.

Special thanks to senior Boyi, who just got her driver's license and was willing to rent a car and take me there when the pandemic had already worsened (~~one dares to drive, one dares to ride~~).

> As this is a photography collection, I don't want to compress the image quality in this column. Each photo is quite large and hosted on Alibaba Cloud OSS (billing alert ⚠️). Loading might be a bit slow, please bear with me.
