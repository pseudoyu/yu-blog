## Preface

Since November, I've been wanting to take proper photos of Nini, but the lighting at home isn't ideal. Due to a busy work schedule, I hadn't deliberately purchased backdrop or lighting equipment. Today, while editing the photos (I mainly just adjust the colors, being lazy), I felt the final images weren't entirely satisfactory. However, I can't abandon my New Year's Day resolution, so I asked a friend to select a few photos that seemed acceptable. It's a good start, at least.

My photographic enlightenment came from a documentary journalist and filmmaker, so I actually pay more attention to composition and elements in the frame. I always hope that each photograph I take has a sense of story and theme (~~low EQ: lack of technical skill~~). Because I love this photo of the cat in the box so much, I named this special collection "Cat In The Box". There's also a scene where the cat happens to be standing on a Murakami book I was halfway through reading. Recalling Murakami's descriptions of cats in his books, which initially sparked my urgent desire to have a cat, it feels like a peculiar fate. So I named that one "Cat and Haruki Murakami". There are also a few shots taken before bedtime, where the lighting is so dark that post-processing couldn't salvage it. But I find them genuinely adorable (it's the photographer's problem), so I've included them as extras, titled "Silence" (yes, I've been a bit obsessed with the Japanese drama "Shizuka na Yuki" recently).

It's been about two years since I last properly picked up a camera to capture anything. I want to start documenting life again and put more effort into photography (~~previously relied purely on mystical aesthetics and photogenic models~~). So I've added a new photography collection column to the project module of my blog, which will serve as a check-in for my photography improvement plan. In the new year, I also want to take more photos of Nini.

> As this is a photography collection, I don't want to compromise on image quality. Each photo is close to 10MB, hosted on Alibaba Cloud OSS (billing alert ⚠️). Loading might be a bit slow, please bear with me.
