## Preface

I've always been a tool enthusiast, firmly believing in the principle "to do a good job, one must first sharpen one's tools." I constantly tinker with and optimize my hardware and software, seeking the best solution for each specific need. Now, I've gradually found solutions that best suit my usage habits. Due to work, study, and personal interests, my devices have gone through many iterations. I'm making a record at this point in time, and will continue to update it in the future, hoping it can be a reference for others.

***This article is only a compilation of hardware and software toolkits as of May 2022. For the latest version, please visit my personal toolkit project maintained on GitHub: "[GitHub - pseudoyu/yu-tools](https://github.com/pseudoyu/yu-tools)".***

> Note: All software services mentioned below are purchased/subscribed by me or educational licenses enjoyed through student status. Please support genuine versions!
