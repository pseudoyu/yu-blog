## ✋ Hi, I'm [Yu Zhang](https://www.pseudoyu.com)

I'm [Yu Zhang](https://www.pseudoyu.com), Blockchain Developer, MSc Graduate in ECIC(Electronic Commerce and Internet Computing) @ The University of Hong Kong (HKU). Love to learn and build things. Follow me on [GitHub](https://github.com/pseudoyu). Know me on [Telegram Channel](https://t.me/pseudoyulife).

I want to learn things and become a better person. I enjoy reading, thinking and writing in my leisure time.

### 🎓 My Goals
***About my life***, I hope I can establish a life-long friendship with my best friends, keep close relationship with my families, and face future challenges with my beloved. Also, I hope to meet interesting friends of diverse background.

***About my career***, I hope I could always be learning and growing during my life and play an active role in the open source software movement.

***Economically***, I hope to be able to choose what to do and shape my own the lifestyle freely.

***About the society***, I hope to have the opportunity to participate in some public welfare or other form of kindness to contribute to the world.

### ⌛️ About Pseudoyu

**Pseudoyu** is my first website. I mainly write about my daily life, study and thoughts here. This blog was initially created on my personal web server using WordPress, and I moved to WeChat Official Account (the same name). Due to the consideration of stability and customization need, I decided to build a new site on GitHub Page with the domain name [pseudoyu.com](https://www.pseudoyu.com/en) and use a static site generator (Hugo) to generate the content.

I named **Pseudoyu** as my blog name quite by chance. I'm stuck for the choice of my HKU uid because my name is really common(but I still want a special one for my further use). Accidently, I found a prefix [*pseudo*](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/pseudo), the word [pseudonym](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/pseudonym) means a name that is not real, the item [pseudocode](https://www.lexico.com/definition/pseudocode) means a notation resembling a simplified programming language in Computer Science world. And one of my favorite cartoons [*Nisemonogatari*](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/偽物語) also focuses on the concept of ***pseudo*** and ***real***. So, why there can't be a pseudo - yu (me)?

I always fall into self-doubt. Whenever I'm talking with my best friend, if the topics are about *initials* or *meanings*, I'll choose to escape. It's difficult for me to feel the simple joy or satisfaction emotions even if I made some achievements and praised by others. I used to regard everything in my life is meaningless. As time goes by, I begin to understand more about it. I wrote a paragh in my another article [*Dear Yu, Are you ready for 23?*](https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2020/06/06/yearly_review_23/), ***"Perhaps, thinking about meaning itself is also a process of constructing meanings. I decide to give up the previous illusion of an 'Aha moment' and just continue moving forward to experience my own life."***

The name **Pseudoyu** also tells myself that I should never constantly struggle with what meaning is anymore. Instead, I will continue to learn, experience and challenge new things. And I can finally accept other's judgement or complain about me like "**You changed**" with pressure.

I hope I can acquire more inputs like new knowledge and ideas, and write more short articles as outputs.
