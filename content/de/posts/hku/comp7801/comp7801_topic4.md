## Background

### Multidimensional Data

* Flat relational tables
* Multimedia feature vectors
* Data warehouse data
* Spatial data
* Text documents

### Attribute Types

* Attributes of multidimensional tuples may have variable types
    * Ordinal (e.g., age, salary)
    * Nominal categorical values (e.g., color, religion)
    * Binary (e.g., gender, owns_property)
* Basic queries: range, NN, similarity

### Basic Queries

* (Range) selection query
    * Returns the records that qualify a (multidimensional) range predicate
    * Example:
        * Return the employees of age between 45 and 50 and salary above $100,000
* Distance (similarity) query
    * Returns the records that are within a distance from a reference record.
    * Example:
        * Find images with feature vectors of Euclidean distance at most ε with the feature vector of a given image
* Nearest neighbor (similarity) query
    * Replaces distance bound by ranking predicate

## Top-k Search Methods

* Rank aggregation
* Index-based methods

### Top-k Query

* Given a set of objects (e.g., relational tuples),
* Returns the k objects with the highest combined score, based on an aggregate function f.
* Example:
    * Relational table containing information about restaurants, with attributes(e.g. price, quality, location)
    * f: sum(-price, quality, -dist(location,my_hotel))‏
    * attribute value ranges are usually normalized
        * E.g., all values in a (0,1) range
        * otherwise some attribute may be favored in f

### Top-k Query Variants

* Apply on single table, or ranked lists of tuples ordered by individual attributes
  ![Top_k_Query_Variants_1](https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/Top_k_Query_Variants_1.jpg)
* Ranked inputs in the same or different servers (centralized or distributed data)
  ![Top_k_Query_Variants_1](https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/Top_k_Query_Variants_2.jpg)
* Standalone query or operator in a more complex query plan
  ![Top_k_Query_Variants_3](https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/Top_k_Query_Variants_3.jpg)

* Incremental retrieval of objects with highest scores (k is not predefined)

* Top-k joins

```sql
SELECT h.id, s.id 
FROM House h School s
WHERE h.location=s.location
ORDER BY h.price + 10 ∗ s.tuition 
LIMIT 5
```

* Probabilistic/approximate top-k retrieval

* Random and/or sorted accesses at ranked inputs

### Top-k Query Evaluation

* Most solutions assume distributive, monotone aggregate functions (e.g. f=sum)
    * distributive: f(x,y,z,w)= f(f(x,y),f(z,w))
        * e.g., A+B+C+D = (A+B) + (C+D)
    * monotone: if x<y and z<w, then f(x,z)<f(y,w)

* Solutions based on 1-D ordering and merging sorted lists (rank aggregation)

* Solutions based on multidimensional indexing

## Rank Aggregation

* Solutions based on 1-D ordering and merging sorted lists (rank aggregation)
* Assume that there is a total ranking of theobjects for each attributethat can be used in top-kqueries
* These sorted inputs canbe accessed sequentiallyand/or by random accesses

### Advantages and Drawbacks

* Advantages：
    * can be applied on any subset of inputs (arbitrary subspace)
    * appropriate for distributed data
    * appropriate for top-k joins
    * easy to understand and implement
* Drawbacks:
    * slower than index-based methods
    * require inputs to be sorted

### TA: Threshold Algorithm

#### Introduction

* Iteratively retrieves objects and their atomic scores from the ranked inputs in a round-robin fashion.
* For each encountered object x, perform random accesses to the inputs where x has not been seen.
* Maintain top-k objects seen so far.
* T = f($l_1$, . . . , $l_m$) is the score derived when applying the aggregation function to the last atomic scores seen at each input. If the score of the k-th object is no smaller than T, terminate.

#### Example of TA(k=1,f=sum)

* **STEP 1**
    * top-1 is c, with score 2.0
    * T=sum(0.9,0.9,0.9)=2.7
    * T>top-1, we proceed to another round of accesses

![TA_Step_1](https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/TA_Step_1.jpg)

* **STEP 2**
    * top-1 is b, with score 2.2
    * T=sum(0.8,0.8,0.9)=2.5
    * T>top-1, we proceed to another round of accesses

![TA_Step_2](https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/TA_Step_2.jpg)

* **STEP 3**
    * top-1 is b, with score 2.2
    * T=sum(0.6,0.6,0.8)=2.0
    * T≤top-1, terminate and output (b,2.2)

#### Properties of TA

* Used as a standard module for merging ranked lists in many applications
* Usually finds the result quickly
* Depends on random accesses, which can be expensive
* random accesses are impossible in some cases
    * e.g., an API allows to access objects incrementally by ranking score, but does not provide the score of a given object

### NRA: No Random Accesses

#### Introduction

* Iteratively retrieves objects and their atomic scores from the ranked inputs in a round-robin fashion.
* For each object x seen so far at any input maintain:
    * f_x_ub: upper bound for x’s aggregate score (f_x)
    * f_x_lb: lower bound for x’s aggregate score (f_x)
* W_k = k objects with the largest f^lb.
* If the smallest f^lb in W_k is at least the largest f_x_ub of any object x not in W_k, then terminate and report W_k as top-k result.

#### Example of NRA(k=1,f=sum)

* **STEP 1**

* **STEP 3**

* **STEP 4**

![NRA_Step_4](https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/NRA_Step_4.jpg)

#### NRA Properties
* More generic than TA, since it does not depend on random accesses
* Can be cheaper than TA, if random accesses are very expensive
* NRA accesses objects sequentially from all inputs and updates the upper bounds for all objects seen so far unconditionally.
    * Cost: O(n) per access (the expected distinct number of objects accessed so far is O(n))
    * No input list is pruned until the algorithm terminates

### LARA: LAttice-based Rank Aggregation

* LARA: An efficient NRA implementation
* Based on 3 observations about the top-k candidates
* Operates differently in the two (growing, shrinking) phases
* Takes its name from the lattice used in the shrinking phase
* Extendable to various top-k query variants
