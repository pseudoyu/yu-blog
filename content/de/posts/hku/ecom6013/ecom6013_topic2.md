# ECOM6013 E-Commerce Technologies

## Topic 2 Internet and E-Commerce Infrasture

**Internet**

* Interconnected network of thousands of networks and hundreds of millions of computers
* Links businesses, educational institutions, government agencies, and individuals

**World Wide Web (WWW)**

* One of the internet's most popular services
* Provides access to billions, possibly trillions, of Web pages

**Evolution of Internet**
* Innovation phase (1961 - 1974)
* Institutionalization phase (1975 - 1995)
* Commercialization Phase (1995 - present)

**Packet Switching**
1. Slices digital messages into packets
2. Sends packets along different communication paths as they become available
3. Reassembles packets once they arrive at destination

It uses routers (special purpose computers that interconnect the computer networks that make up the internet and route packets)

Less expensive, wasteful than circuit-switching

**TCP/IP**

Four TCP/IP Layers
* Application layer (HTTPS - Web, Telnet - Terminal, FTP - Files, SMTP - E-mail)
* Transport layer (TCP)
* Internet layer (IP)
* Network interface layer (Ethernet)

IPv4
* 32-bit number (handle up to 4 billion addresses)
* Four sets of numbers (201.61.186.227)

IPv6
* 128-bit number (handle up to 1 quadrillion addresses)

**Domain Names, DNS, and URLs**
* Domain Name: IP address expressed in natural language
* Domain Name System (DNS): Allows numeric IP addresses to be expressed in natural language
* Uniform resource locator (URL): Address used by Web browser to identify location of content on the Web

**DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**

How computer gets its IP Address

**Client/Server Computing**

Powerful personal computers (clients) connectd in network with one or more servers
* Storing files
* Software applications
* Access to printers, and so on

**The Mobile Platform**
* Tablets
* Smartphones (disruptive technology): New processors & New operating systems

**Cloud Computing**

Firms and individuals obtain computing power and software over Internet (public, private and hybrid clouds)

Three Types of Services
* Infrasture as a service (IaaS)
* Software as a service (SaaS)
* Platform as a service (PaaS)

Reduces Cost of
* Building and operating Websites
* Infrasture, IT support
* Hardware, software

Drawbacks
* Security risks
* Shifts responsibility for storage and control to providers

**Internet Infrasture**

Internet growth has boomed without disruption because of
* Client/server computing mode
* Hourglass, layered architecture

![hourglass_model](https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/hourglass_model.png)

* Applications
* Middleware Services
* Transport Services and Representation Standards
* Network Technology Substrate

**Internet Network Architecture**

**[Three Tiers Internet](https://www.thousandeyes.com/learning/techtorials/isp-tiers)**

![three_tiers_internet](https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/three_tiers_internet.png)

**The Internet Backbone**

Comprised of fiber-optic cable
* Faster speeds and greater bandwidth
* Thinner, lighter cables
* Less interference
* Better data security

Tier 1 Internet Service Providers (Tier 1 ISPs) or transit ISPs

Numberous private networks physically connected to each other

Underseas fiber optics, satellite links

**Internet Exchange Points (IXPs)**

Originally called Network access Points (NAPs) or Metropolitan Area Exchanges (MAEs)

* Regional hubs where Tier 1 ISPs physically connect with one another and with regional Tier 2 ISPs
* Tier 2 ISPs provide Tier 3 ISPs with Internet access

**Tier 3 Internet Services Providers**

Services
* Narrowband
* Broadband
* Digital subscriber line (DSL)
* Cable Internet
* Satellite Internet

**Campus/Corporate Area Networks**
* Local area networks operating within single organization
* Lease Internet access directly from regional and national carriers

**Mobile Internet Access**

Telephone-based
* 3G/4G technologies now
* 5G - higher bandwidth (10 Gbps), lower latency

Computer network-based (wireless local area network-based)
* Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11 standards)
    * High speed, fixed broadband wireless LAN (WLAN)
    * Wireless access point (Hot Spots)
    * Limited range but inexpensive
* Zigbee, Bluetooth, BLE
* Low-power WAN - LoRaWan

**Intranets**
* TCP/IP network located within a single organization for communications and processing
* Used by private and government organizations for iternal networks
* All Internet application can be used in private intranets

**The Internet of Things (IOT)**
* Objects connected via sensors/RFID to Internet
* Interoperability issues and standards
* Security and privacy concerns

*"Smart things"*

**Limitations of the Current Internet**

Bandwidth
* Slow peak-hour service

Quality of Service
* Lantency

Network Architecture
* Identical requests are processed individually

Wired Internet
* Copper and expensive fiber-optic cables

**Who Governs the Internet?**
* Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN)
* Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
* Internet Research Task Force (IRTF)
* Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG)
* Internet Architecture Board (IAB)
* Internet Society (ISOC)
* Internet Governance Forum (IGF)
* World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
* Internet Network Operators Groups (NOGs)

**The Web**
* Web invented (1989 - 1991)
* Mosaic web browser w/GUI (1993)
* Netscape Navigator, first commerical web browser (1994)
* Microsoft Internet Explorer (1995)

**Hypertext**
* Text formatted with embedded links
* Use Hypertext Transfer  Protocol (HTTP) and URLs to locate resources on the web

**Markup Languages**
* HTML - Hypertext Markup Language
* XML - eXtensible Markup Language (Tags used are defined by user)

**Web Servers and Clients**
* Web server (web servers or physical server)
* Web server softwares (FTP, search engine, data capture, security services)
