# ECOM6013 E-Commerce Technologies

## Topic 6 E-Commerce Security

**Good E-Commerce Security**
* Highest degree of security
  * New technologies
  * Organizational policies and procedures
  * Industry standards and government law
* Other factors
  * Cost of security vs. potential loss
  * Security often breaks at weakest link

**The Tense Between Security and Other Values**
* Security vs. Easy of use
  * More Secure -> More difficult to use + slower
* Security vs. Desire of individuals to act anonmously

**Basic E-Commerce Security Issues and Landscape**
* E-Commerce security requirements
  * Authentication (verify the real identity)
  * Authorization (determine the entity's access)
  * Auditing
  * Availability
  * Nonrepudiation (assurance that trading partners can't falsely deny their purchase or transaction)
* Risk (a vulnerability will be known and used)
* Social engineering (non-technical attack, trick users to do some certain actions)
* Spam

**E-Commerce of Today**
* Threats
  * Money thefts
  * Identity thefts
  * Malware
* Solutions
  * Authentication
  * Intrusion checking
  * Firewalls
  * Education

**Security Threats in the E-Commerce Environment**
* Three key points of vulnerability
  * Client
  * Server
  * Communication pipeline (network channels)

**Most Common Security Threats**
* Malicious code
  * Viruses
  * Worms
  * Ransomeware
  * Trojan horses
  * Backdoors
  * Bots, botnets
* Unwanted programs
  * Browser parasites
  * Adware
  * Spyware
* Phishing
  * Deceptive online attack to obtain confidential information
  * Social engineering, e-mail scams, spoofing legitimate websites
  * Used for identity fraud and theft
* Hacking and cybervandalism
  * Hackers vs. Crackers
  * Cybervandalism (intentionally disrupting, defacing, destroying websites)
  * Hacktivism
* Data breach
* Credit card fraud/theft
* Spoofing
* Pharming
* Spam / junk websites
* Denial of sevices (DoS) attack (useless traffic to overwhelm network)
* Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack (multiple computers to attack target network)
* Sniffing (eavesdropping program that monitors information traveling over a network)
* Insider jobs
  * Single financial threats
  * Poorly designed security policy and server / client software
* Social network issues
* Mobile platform issues
* Cloud security issues
* IoT security issues

**The Information Assurance Model and Defense Objectives**
* CIA security triad
  * Confidentiality
  * Integrity
  * Availability

**Three Dimensions in Internet Security**
* Integrity
* Nonrepudiation
* Authenticity
* Confidentiality
* Privacy
* Availability

**Technology Solutions**
* Protecting internet communications
  * Cryptography
* Securing channels of communication
  * SSL, TLS
    * Establishes a secure, negotiated client-server session in which URL of requested document, along with contents, is encrypted
    * ![ssl_protect](https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/ssl_protect.png)
  * S-HTTP
    * Provides a secure message-oriented communications protocol designed for use in conjunction with HTTP
  * VPNs
    * Allows remote users to securely access internal network via the Internet, using Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP)
  * Wi-Fi
* Protecting networks
  * Firewalls
  * Proxy servers
  * Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
  * ![firewall](https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/firewall.png)
* Protecting servers and clients
  * OS security
    * Upgrades
    * Patches
  * Anti-virus software
    * Easiest and least expensive way to prevent threats to system integrity
    * Requires daily updates

**Managing Risks**
* Technology
* Effective management policies
* Public laws and active enforcement

**A Security Plan: Management Policies**
* Risk assessment
* Security policy
* Implementation plan
  * Security organization
  * Access controls
  * Authentication procedures, including biometrics
  * Authorization policies, authorization management systems
* Security audit

**Basic Concepts of User Authentication**
* Something you know
  * Password
  * PIN
  * OTP
  * ...
* Something you have
  * Physical key
  * Token
  * Magnetic card
  * Smartcard
  * ...
* Something you are
  * Fingerprint
  * Voice
  * ...

*Best use 2 Factors Authentication (2FA)*

**Encryption**
* Transfer data into cipher text readable only by sender and receiver
* Secures stored information and information transmission
* Provide 4/6 key dimensions of E-Commerce security
  * authentication
  * Confidentiality
  * Message Integrity
  * Nonrepudiation

**Symmetric Key Cryptography**
* Sender and receiver use same digital key to encrypt and decrypt message
* Requires different set of keys for each transaction
* Strength of encryption
  * Length of binary key used to encrypt data
* Standards
  * Data Encryption Standard (DES, 1977)
  * Advanced Encryption Standard (AES, 2000)
  * Other standards use keys with up to 2,048 bits

**Public Key Cryptography**
* Uses two mathematically related digital keys
  * Public key (widely disseminated)
  * Private key (kept secret by owner)
* Both keys used to encrypt and decrypt message
  * Once key used to encrypt message, same key cannot be used to decrypt message
  * Sender uses recipient’s public key to encrypt message
  * Recipient uses his/her private key to decrypt it

![public_key_cryptography](https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/public_key_cryptography.png)

**Public Key Encryption Using Digital Signatures and Hash Digests**
* Hash function
  * Mathematical algorithm (e.g. MD5 and SHA-1) that produces fixed-length number called message or hash digest
* Sender applies hash function to the message and then encrypts the message AND the hash digest with recipient’s public key
* Sender then encrypts the whole package with sender’s private key, creating digital signature for authenticity, nonrepudiation
* Recipient first uses sender’s public key to authenticate the message and then the recipient’s private key to decrypt the hash digest and the message

![public_key_cryptography_digital_signature](https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/public_key_cryptography_digital_signature.png)

**Digital Envelop**
* Addresses weaknesses of
  * Public key encryption (computationally slow)
  * Symmetric key encryption (insecure transmission lines)
* Uses symmetric key encryption to encrypt document
* Uses public key encryption to encrypt and send symmetric key

![digital_envelop](https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/digital_envelop.png)

**Digital Certificates and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)**
* Digital certificate
  * Name of subjects/company
  * Subject's public key
  * Digital certificate serial number
  * Expiration date, issuance date
  * Digital signature of certification authority (trusted third party institution) that issues certificate
* Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
  * CAs and digital certificate procedures that are accepted by all parties

![digital_certificate](https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/digital_certificate.png)

**Limits to Encryption Solutions**
* Doesn’t protect storage of private key
* No guarantee that verifying computer of merchant is secure
* CAs are unregulated, self-selecting organizations
