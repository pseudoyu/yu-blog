**Network Core**

*Mesh of interconnected routers*

* Packet-switching (hosts break application-layer messages into packets)
  * Forward packets from one router to the next
  * Each packet transmitted a full link capacity

* Packet transmission delay

![packet_switch](https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/packet_switch.png)

```sh
	Packet transmission delay = L (bits) / R (bits/sec)
```

* End-end delay

![store_and_forward](https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/store_and_forward.png)

```sh
	End-end delay = 2L (bits) / R (bits/sec)
	(Assuming zero propagation delay)
```

* Store and forward: entire packet must arrive at router before it can be transmitted on next link

* Packet queuing and loss
  * If arrival rate > transmission rate, packets will queue
  * If memory fills up, packets can be dropped
  * Bigger buffer can bring lower packet loss but higher delay+buffer cost

* Two key network-core functios
  * Forwarding
    * Local action: input link -> output link
  * Routing
    * Global action: source -> destinatin
    * Routing algorithms

* Circuit switching
  * End-end resources allocated to, reserved for "call" between source&dest

![circuit_switching](https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/circuit_switching.png)

* Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM)

![fdm](https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/fdm.png)

* Time Division Multiplexing (TDM)

![tdm](https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/tdm.png)

**Packet Switching vs. Circuit Switching**
* Packet switching is great for bursty data
  * Resource sharing
  * Simpler, no call setup
* Packet switching can cause excessive congestion
* Combined: Virtual Circuit Packet Switching

**Internet Structure: Network of networks**
* Hosts connected to internet
* Access ISPs (Internet Service Providers)
  * To ensure every two hosts can send packets to each other, access ISPs must be interconnected

![isp_tiers](https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/isp_tiers.png)

* Tier-1 ISP
  * Sprint, AT&T, NTT
  * National & international coverage
* Content provider network (private network)
  * Google
  * Facebook

**Delay and Loss**
* Nodal processing
* Queueing delay
* ![queueing_delay](https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/queueing_delay.png)
  * R: link bandwidth (bps)
  * L: packet length (bits)
  * a: average packet arrival rate
  * Traffic intensity = La / R
  * E(x) = La/R / (1 - La/R)
* Transmission delay
  * L(packet length) / R (link bandwidth)
* Propagation delay
  * d (length of physical link) / s (propagation speed)

![packet_delay](https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/packet_delay.png)

```sh
	d(nodal) = d(proc) + d(queue) + d(trans) + d(prop)
```

**Example**

```sh
	Number of hops = M
	Per-hop processing delay = d(proc)
	Link propagation delay = d(prop)
	Packet transmission delay = d(trans)
	Message size = N packets

	End-to-end Delay (ignoring queueing delay)
	= M * d(prop) + N * d(trans) + (M-1) * d(trans) + (M-1) * d(proc)
```

**Packet Loss**
* Queen (buffer) preceding link in buffer has finite capcity
* Packet arriving to full queue dropped (lost)
* Lost packet may be retransmitted by previous node, end system or not at all

![packet_loss](https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/packet_loss.png)

**Throughput**
* Rate (bits/time) at which bits transferred from sender to receiver
  * Instantaneous: rate at given point in time
  * Average: rate over longer period of time
* Bottleneck link
  * link on end-end path that constrains end-end throughput
  * ![throughput](https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/throughput.png)
  * Per-connection end-end throughput
    * min(Rc, Rs, R/10)
    * In practice, Rc or Rs is often bottleneck

**Why Layering**
