# COMP7404 Computational Intelligence and Machine Learning

## Topic 2 Beyond Classical Search

**Planning vs Identification**
* Planing: sequence of actions
  * The path to the goal is the important thing
  * Paths have various costs, depths
  * Heuristics to guide, frontier to keep backups
* Identification: assignments to variables
  * The goal itself is important, not the path

*Local Search can find solutions faster for specific types of identification problems*

**Local Search**
* Evaluate and modify one current state rather than systematically explore paths from an initial state
* Suitable for problems were all that matters in the solution state and not the path cost to reach it
* Although local search algorithms are not systematic they have two advantages
  * Require very little memory
  * Often find reasonable solutions in large spaces

**Local Search Algorithm**

```sh
	Randomly initialize currentState
	If cost of currentState == 0 return currentState
	If min(cost(getNeighbors(currentState))) > cost(currentState)
		goto step 1 (we have reached a local minimum)
	Select cheapest neighbor as currentState and goto step2
```

**Example: 8-Queens**
* States
  * Each state has 8 queens on board, one per column
* Successors
  * All possible states generated by moving single queen to another square in the same column
* Cost function
  * Number of pairs of queens that are attacking each other, either directly and indirectly

**Constraint Satisfaction Problems**

CSPs use a factored representation for states
* A set of variables, each of which has a value

**Defining CSPs**
* A CSP consists of three components
  * A set of variables, X = {X1,...,Xn}
  * A set of domains, D = {D1,...,Dn}, where Di = {V1,...,Vk} for each variable Xi
  * A set of constraints C which specify allowable combinations of values
* To solve a CSP we need to define a state space
  * Each state is defined by an assignment of values to some or all variables {Xi = Vi, Xj = Vj,...}

**Solving CSPs**
* States are defined by the values assigned so far
* Initial state
  * Empty assignment {}
* Successor function
  * Assign a value to an unassigned variable
* Goal test
  * Current assignment is complete and consistent

**Solutiona to CSPs**
* Consistent - No constraints are violated
* Complete - Every variable is assigned

**Backtracking Search (The basic algorithm for solving CSPs)**

Idea
* Only consider assignments to a single variable at each point
* Only allow legal assignemnts to each point

DFS with these two ideas is called backtracking search

**Improving Backchecking**

Idea
* Forward checking (FC)
* Constraint propagation (AC-3)

**Filtering: Forward Checking**
* Filtering
  * Keep track of domains for unassigned variables and cross off bad options
* Forward checking
  * Cross off values that violate a constraint when added to the existing assignment

**Improving Backtracking Further**
* Variable Ordering
  * Minimum remaining values (MRV)
    * Choose the variable with the fewest legal left values in its domain
      * Most constraint variable
      * Fail-first heuristic
    * Tie-breaker among MRV variables
      * Degree Heuristic (Deg)
        * Choose the variable with the most constraints on remaining variables
* Value Ordering
  * Least constraining value (LCV)
    * Choose the value that rules out the fewest values in the remaining variables
