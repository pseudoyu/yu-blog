## Preface

This article is a record and reflection of my life from `2023-09-05` to `2023-09-13`. I concentrated on writing a contract project that wasn't particularly complex, and also revisited my learning experience and insights on contract development due to an interview with a content creator friend, continuing to produce my series of tutorials. A publishing house contacted me, and I might start writing a technical book, which I'm both looking forward to and feeling a bit anxious about. Due to hair quality issues and some personal reasons, I temporarily cut off my long hair and started growing it again, which is probably the biggest change recently. I wrote an article about building a knowledge system that I really like, rediscovering the most fundamental joy in writing. I'm also seeing my weekly review mentioned in more and more blog posts, which makes me happy but also a bit embarrassed, and I've been rethinking my original intention of writing these reviews. There are many other interesting things as well.

## Farewell to Long Hair

Although it might seem a bit sentimental to write a whole theme about getting a haircut, I still have some feelings about it.

I've had long and blue hair for a year now. From the initial slight discomfort to it gradually becoming a kind of symbol of myself in a sense, it has accompanied me for a long time, through several distinctly different life states. At the end of last year, I dyed it blue just because I wanted a change of style, fulfilling my small anime-inspired wish. Coincidentally, just a couple of months later, Beijing went into lockdown due to the pandemic, and I couldn't go out to get a haircut. By the time things truly opened up, it had already grown to a decent length. I bought a few cool headbands and decided to just keep it long. That was a year ago.

It's interesting how when your appearance leaves a noticeable impression on people, your inner self seems to have fewer constraints and concerns. I found myself chatting with a Middle Eastern investor who was interested in my headband all the way through the Web3 Festival in Hong Kong; I had people from other booths approach me saying, "I've noticed you for a while, you're very eye-catching"; I was recognized by a high school classmate who's also in Web3, whom I hadn't been in contact with for nearly ten years - it was surprising but also delightful. Perhaps I always had the desire to share and communicate, but was hesitant due to some social anxiety and concerns about others' reactions. My hairstyle and color gave me some courage to expose myself in crowds, like a kind of protective coloration.

As the color had faded quite a bit, and my hair had become somewhat frizzy due to damage from bleaching several times, and also because I have an important occasion at the end of the month, I made up my mind to cut off the long hair first and grow it out again for a while. I acted on this idea the very next day. After cutting it, I didn't feel as uncomfortable as I had imagined. Instead, I felt somewhat relieved. Perhaps this year brought not only changes in hair length, but also gradual changes in my mindset. I've gained more courage to face the world.

Coincidentally, STRRL also cut off his long hair, which he had been growing for two years, around the same time. ~~Liangzhu Village has lost two long-haired boys~~.

## The Original Intention of Weekly Reviews

During the week, I published an article "[Personal Information Acquisition and Knowledge Management System (Heptabase + Logseq + Readwise)](https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2023/09/05/my_personal_pkm_input_output_system/)". A few hours of writing turned a derivative idea from a weekly review into a reasonably structured article. It had been a long time since I had created something so effortlessly and enjoyably.

I've accumulated more and more topics I want to write about, and for most of them, I already have enough material to start writing. But I often hesitate, feeling that I'm "not qualified" to convey and evaluate. Take this article about the knowledge system, for example. I've only been paying for Heptabase for about two weeks, and even less for Readwise. In terms of functionality, I'm not particularly familiar with all the modules. But when I started writing, it seemed that my years of thinking and practice about this system all transformed into paragraphs of text. I wrote so much without realizing it, which was a wonderful feeling. So perhaps what's important is still independent thinking and writing it down, rather than needing to match the comprehensiveness of textbooks or documentation.

Only the weekly review is a dialogue with my future self, and I always feel relaxed when writing it. After all, I'm the most qualified person to record and examine myself.

This week, I saw mentions of how my weekly review format has influenced several friends in their own reviews. While I'm happy about this, I also feel a bit guilty. It seems I haven't been publishing on time for a long time (~~even this one~~). Even after delaying for a long time, the finished product still feels rushed. After publishing, I often remember some interesting things I forgot to mention, and think, I'll mention it next time. And so it goes on.

Life is full of little everyday moments. Just like how I like to use my camera to capture small scenes on the street, words are my viewfinder for facing this world. I hope I can leave more behind, and more vividly. It seems that only in this way can those memories and beautiful things be preserved more.

## Reading and Book Notes

![notes_about_how_to_writing](https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/notes_about_how_to_writing.png)

This week, I came across an interesting article "[Introduction to Writing](https://hanyang.wtf/p/c7a)". It's about some principles of writing shared by the author who recently wrote a viral research report about Binance. In fact, I often don't pay much attention to the "techniques" in photography and writing, usually following my own feelings and so-called aesthetics. But I often worry that my lack of expressive power might prevent me from recording my inner thoughts and what I want to express. So this article is quite interesting. I made some notes while reading and synchronized them to Logseq.

## Interesting Things and Objects

### Learning

#### Arbitrum Stylus

[Stylus](https://arbitrum.io/stylus) is a framework that allows running Rust contracts on EVM architecture chains. It's quite imaginative. I'm thinking about getting into Rust again with a purpose.

#### Introduction to Investment

Meng Yan's video "[How Does Investment Make Money?](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1e8411B7w7)" is really good. It's similar to the narrative style of "[How The Economic Machine Works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFV7wdEX-Mo)". I learned a lot about concepts related to stocks, funds, and indices that were previously a bit vague to me, and also gained some understanding of investment principles and strategies. I took notes in [Heptabase](https://app.heptabase.com/w/2dee654ba9e5a73e11df473bb420c877f5f00c7a1998545981d07da1bb6fe942) while watching, and I'm sharing them here.

~~By the way, I also finally got a bit of an understanding of what my senior is doing.~~

### Others

### Input

Although most interesting inputs are automatically synced to the "[Yu's Life](https://t.me/pseudoyulife)" Telegram channel, I'll still list some of them here. It feels more like a newsletter now.
