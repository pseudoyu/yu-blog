## Preface

This is a record and reflection of my life from `2023-02-01` to `2023-02-06`.

It's the first week back at work. Since I had been doing some work during the Spring Festival, I wasn't unaccustomed to the work rhythm. However, I often couldn't freely do my own things, which suddenly made me feel pressed for time.

I started revisiting Japanese and was surprised to find that I still remembered a lot. Over the weekend, I watched some new dramas and went to the cinema for the first time in a year. I received the long-awaited Steam Deck and spent some time configuring it. On Monday, I started trying to feed Nie Nie chicken wings (which are said to be good for her coat), and she seems to have a good appetite and isn't picky. After half a year, I reorganized the kitchen and started cooking for myself, which has lasted for three days now. On Monday, I went out to eat the Okonomiyaki I had been craving. There were many other interesting things as well.

## Japanese Learning

Because I plan to go to Japan, I set a flag at the beginning of the year to revisit Japanese. The last time I studied was probably six or seven years ago. Fortunately, I haven't forgotten the fifty sounds and some basic grammar, so it didn't take too long to pick up. However, because I now have the pressure of taking a certification exam, I've started studying seriously again.

### Course Resources

Previously, I had been watching Mr. Ye's New Standard Japanese Elementary course on Hujiang Online School, which is a relatively classic textbook. There are official recorded courses on Bilibili:

- [【Japanese Course】Standard Japanese Elementary Intensive Lecture BY Adorable Mr. Ye](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1es41127PE/)

Recently, I saw a Japanese learning [thread](https://twitter.com/yellow532486/status/1619895028201189377) by a blogger named [Yellow](https://twitter.com/yellow532486) on Twitter. They use "Minna no Nihongo" and also mentioned a companion YouTube tutorial by a Japanese teacher in Taiwan. It seems interesting, and I want to try it:

### Supplementary Materials

Regarding vocabulary and grammar learning, I recalled listening to a podcast channel every day on my way to class when I was a freshman to memorize some grammar points. It was very effective (~~mainly because the voice was so pleasant to listen to~~):

- [《Myrcella's Japanese Corner》- Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/cn/podcast/myrcella%E7%9A%84%E6%97%A5%E8%AF%AD%E8%A7%92/id875790959)

Because I'm accustomed to the learning mode of books + courses, I didn't look for other auxiliary resources in the early stages. I plan to focus on laying a solid foundation first.

### Input Method

After solving the learning material problem, the next issue was the input method. For iOS, I use the native input method, without any modifications.

For my daily macOS use, because I need double pinyin, I use the [Rime Input Method](https://rime.im/), and I've configured it to remove the system's native ABC input method following this article:

- [Mac Delete Native English ABC](https://ssnhd.com/2022/01/01/mac-inputdel/)

So I didn't want to add a new system native input method for Japanese. Instead, I found a Japanese tuning scheme suitable for Rime, which has been great so far:

- [GitHub - gkovacs/rime-japanese: Japanese Input Method](https://github.com/gkovacs/rime-japanese)

The usage effect is as follows:

![japanese_rime_input](https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/japanese_rime_input.png)

However, there's a problem: after using double pinyin for a long time, sometimes when typing in romaji, I unconsciously type in double pinyin. I'm still struggling to adapt...

## Interesting Things and Objects

### Steam Deck

The happiest thing this week was receiving the Steam Deck sent by my dear friend. Although it had actually arrived in December, shipping to Hong Kong wasn't convenient, so I didn't get my hands on it until after the New Year. It's much bigger than I imagined, but not heavy, and the feel is super comfortable.

Although I've bought many Switch games like a squirrel, I actually rarely play them. I've always found it difficult to truly relax through gaming as a form of entertainment. Ni has been urging me to play games for so many years, but to little effect. After switching to Mac, I even rarely opened Steam. This time, I finally have no excuse about not having the right device, haha. I plan to regularly experience some classic games in the future.

By the way, the exclusive skin that came with the Steam Deck is really cool.

### Input

#### Articles

Although some interesting articles are automatically synced in my [Telegram channel](https://t.me/pseudoyulife), I'll still select a few to list here. It feels more like a newsletter this way.

#### Podcasts

Because I had less commute time this week, I didn't listen to many podcasts. The one that left a deep impression was:

- [Ep.22 [CN]: The Rise and Fall of Solana: Many Coincidences and a Few Inevitabilities | HODLong](https://hodlong-hou-lang.simplecast.com/episodes/ep22-cn-solana-OtNe4Ybk?utm_source=listennotes.com&utm_campaign=Listen%20Notes&utm_medium=website)

#### Videos

Similarly, I've also recorded some interesting videos I watched:

- [Humanity Won't Thank Luo Ji](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1rT411o71x/)
- [The Painful Life of Contractor Michelangelo](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1NT411Z7C9/)

- [If You Still Want to Quit Your Job and Pursue Your Dreams After Watching This Video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1uG4y1U7jX/)

#### Books

- **Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World**, currently reading. It's been a long time since I've felt such anticipation from a novel. Perhaps it's because of the narrative style, or because I read a few short chapters each time during my journeys, which creates some discontinuity. I always want to know what will happen next, but I don't want to rush through and miss such beautiful writing. Also, the setting of "another space" reminds me of an old but equally interesting game, "Waste City Story".

#### TV Series

- **The Last of Us**, I had heard about the game before, and recently a TV series was released. I watched the first two episodes, and it's not bad. I'll continue to follow it.
- **The Three-Body Problem**, I started watching this series because I was disappointed with the animation. Surprisingly, it's quite good. I really like Yu Hewei. The pace of the series is a bit slow, and sometimes it's a bit hard to watch the Three-Body game parts, but overall it's worth following. I'm also looking forward to the Netflix version.
- **The Knockout**, It seems that apart from the Fog Theater, I haven't followed many new dramas of this genre in recent years. But because of the many discussions, I took a look and was quite pleasantly surprised. Even though there are inevitably some politically correct compromises, it's still quite bold. Even the minor characters are well-developed, but the ending was a bit abstract. In this genre, I would still recommend "The Silent Truth" more.

#### Movies

- **Deep Sea**, I had heard some not-so-good reviews, but maybe because it was the first movie I've seen in a theater in over half a year, there was some emotional bonus, and I thought it was quite good. A little girl's dream, a Spirited Away-like fairy tale world, slightly exaggerated performances, and fairly appropriate BGM (except for the "Little White Boat" which suddenly took me out of the movie to "The Bad Kids"). At least we can see that Chinese animated films are trying to explore smaller and more delicate perspectives to present, rather than just various myths and legends.

## Personal Life Snapshots

### Life

This week felt like it passed magically. After the New Year, I took three days off. On the first day back at work, I came home early because I was worried about Nie Nie and bought a mobile camera. On the third day, I went home early because there was a fire in the building below our company. On the fourth day, because the project manager and tester went skiing and hot spring bathing together, I also worked from home. All in all, I only worked two days in the office, but I still completed my work.

Although there were no casualties in the fire, it's still quite scary that it happened in the city center. However, at times like this, I found that everyone around me, from family to friends, has a bit of a comedian in them.

![thursday_fire_tweet](https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/thursday_fire_tweet.png)

> Our company building caught fire🔥 at noon, there was smoke everywhere, and nine fire trucks came.
>
> Project manager sister: I risked my life to bring your computer down (remember to work overtime when you get back).
> My family: It's good that the computer was brought down.
>
> Is the computer my true self? 🙃

On the weekend, I had planned quite a bit of work, but because I was watching "The Knockout" and "The Three-Body Problem", my efficiency was high but the completion amount was not enough. I'll have to make up for a lot this week.

On Sunday night, because a friend happened to be watching a movie near my house, they invited me to go together. We didn't choose the more popular "The Wandering Earth 2" or "Full River Red", but watched "Deep Sea". It wasn't until I entered the cinema that I realized it had been a long time since I had watched a movie offline. There is indeed some emotional bonus, and I will try to go watch more movies by myself in the future.

On Monday night, I went to eat the Okonomiyaki that I had been craving for several months.

![screenshot_from_silent](https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/screenshot_from_silent.jpg)

Actually, the reason was that when watching "Silent Snow", I saw that they just love to eat various things, especially teppanyaki Okonomiyaki, which looks very appetizing. I had complained to a friend before:

![some_thoughts_about_silent](https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/some_thoughts_about_silent.png)

But because of my chosen worker physique, I hadn't caught COVID yet (until now), and I was afraid to go out before the New Year. Now I've become more relaxed and am eating, drinking, and having fun everywhere.

![beer_and_monday](https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/beer_and_monday.png)

> "Eh, Okonomiyaki?"
>
> Finally ate the Okonomiyaki that I had been craving for a long time because of a scene in a Japanese drama. Indeed, a worker's Monday and draft beer are a perfect match!

Thanks to senior Boyi for being my regular dining companion, saving me from the miserable moment of drinking two glasses of draft beer alone. My happy playtime in Beijing has increased again.

### Nie Nie

#### Through the Lens

Because I couldn't find Nie Nie in the camera and was worried, I later bought a mobile monitoring robot. While debugging, I accidentally took several photos that I think are so cute. With the camera later, I felt much more at ease.

#### On Nie Nie's MBTI

This week, I had an interesting topic discussion with a friend. I was asked what personality I think Nie Nie has, a question I had never thought about but found very interesting.

![nie_nie_personality_01](https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/nie_nie_personality_01.png)

![nie_nie_personality_02](https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/nie_nie_personality_02.png)

![nie_nie_personality_03](https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/nie_nie_personality_03.png)

This is quite an interesting proposition because cats can't take the test themselves, and the personality we see in them is often shaped by our observations from daily interactions and our own wishful thinking. To some extent, it's also a projection of our various concepts. It's a novel perspective. Actually, it's been a long time since I've had such a comfortable and interesting conversation with friends, and I cherish it.
