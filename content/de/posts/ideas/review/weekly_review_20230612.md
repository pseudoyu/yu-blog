## Preface

This is a record and reflection of my life from May 30, 2023 to June 12, 2023.

On the first day of June, I told a friend, "I'm usually quite miserable every May, June will definitely be my lucky month." Whether it was a psychological effect or the power of will, these two weeks after entering June have seen improvements in various aspects. I managed to refactor some business code during work tasks, reducing many potential issues. STRRL and I attended Rokid's offline experience event, where I even met my idol developer, Tulading. Although I no longer care much about birthday rituals, a group of friends still remembered and prepared some small surprises. It seems that after my birthday, I started to gradually step out of my small world. I met with old high school friends whom I hadn't seen for seven or eight years, rekindling some emotions. Over the weekend, I made a flash trip to Beijing to attend Gopher China 2023, ate and played with senior Boyi, had dinner and chatted with Homura, and went to Noy's house to pet cats. There were many other interesting things too.

## The Ritual of Birthdays

![comments_about_birthday](https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/comments_about_birthday.png)

A few days ago, I received a comment from a reader friend, talking about the perception of birthdays and how attitudes towards things change after starting work. I can actually relate to this quite well. I used to care a lot about birthdays. I'm not sure if it was about the day itself or if I wanted to confirm my importance to those around me through this way. Every year as the time approached, I would start to look forward to it and often called up a large group of people to gather and celebrate.

As I gradually left my familiar life circle and rarely met with close friends, I no longer had this obsession. Fortunately, there are still some friends who remember and send blessings, giving me a sense of what a birthday feels like.

This year, perhaps because I made a promise to sort out my emotions and feelings on my birthday every year, I started browsing through my previous weekly reviews early and thinking about my thoughts and feelings over the past year. Only then did I realize that besides the increase in numbers, so many changes had occurred. Of course, some of these changes were positive, while others were not so satisfactory. But having this review naturally brings some expectations. I think the meaning and ritual of this year's birthday stems from this.

Self-reflection through writing has given me so much. As I replied to this friend's comment: "At least for myself, my way out of the quagmire is through words. The weekly review is, to some extent, my self-redemption."

Additionally, I was surprised and grateful for the comments and blessings from many unfamiliar friends on the article "A 26-Year-Old's Confession: The Stone Pusher". It was very heartwarming. You all accompanied me through a meaningful day, and I hope we can continue to walk together.

### Input, Output, and Time Management

![time_management_comments](https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/time_management_comments.png)

I received a comment on a somewhat distant weekly review about efficiency and time management. To be honest, answering this question now is a bit embarrassing. Last year, I was quite satisfied with the quality and quantity of my input and output, but there wasn't really any scientific method. Initially, I was just focused on investing all my time in self-improvement to escape from some things, so even when I was busy, I still managed to find a lot of time to do what I liked.

As I gradually immersed myself in some technical learning and interest exploration, I also started to have some output and positive feedback. If I skipped the weekly review for a week or two, I would receive quite a few reminders to update, which naturally gave me more motivation to keep going. I've always enjoyed the "Learn/Build in public" approach. Apart from blogs and tweets, my Telegram channel "Yu's Life" used for synchronization mostly syncs my likes, favorites, and forwards. In fact, just like how I never set my Moments to be visible only to certain groups, I don't distinguish between public/private accounts or lists at all, which means all my behaviors are completely transparent.

When I finish a day's work or have some free time, if I feel like I haven't had much extra input that day, I'll have a kind of motivation to read a few articles/tutorials saved in my "read later" list, open Kindle to read a half-finished book, or find a movie from my Douban list that I've been wanting to watch. Unknowingly, this has become a habit. I often browse through my channel as a way of organizing information, and when I see that my output has been sporadic, I feel a bit guilty.

So when there are no updates on my channel for several consecutive days, ~~it's probably because I'm slacking off~~.

As for time management, I can't say I have any good practices. I mainly use Logseq for basic task recording and Cron for schedule management (I only started using it frequently recently, and the menu bar schedule reminders are quite useful). I haven't deliberately used tools like the Pomodoro technique for strict management for a long time. I'm more used to arranging things according to my immersion state rather than according to fixed time blocks.

In terms of energy management, the only thing I can say is that I maintain a relatively low level of demand for eating, drinking, playing, and sleeping. Often, I'll just have one casual meal or some fruit in a day, and I don't really have any hobbies that kill time, so I have a bit more time. Of course, this doesn't mean all this time is spent meaningfully. There are often times when it's wasted, but I don't have any strict standards for myself, so I can maintain a relatively balanced state.

~~Don't learn from sleeping at five and waking up at eight~~. In the "Vanishing Sleep" part of my previous weekly review, I just reflected on this myself.

## Personal Life Snapshots

After going out to participate in the Open Source Summer event, I started to become interested in participating in these technology/science/digital events and became more willing to go out and meet some friends.

![nienie_space_at_home](https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/nienie_space_at_home.jpg)

I invited two friends who came to Hangzhou from Beijing to come to my home to play with Nini. I enthusiastically introduced them to some smart pet home products from Petkit. They were completely defenseless against these electronic toys, but I didn't have anything new to tinker with myself, so Nini became the "victim". Basically, we can track her every move in the app, even measuring her food intake down to the gram.

Nini was also called a toy cat/ornament by friends. She would just stay still wherever we put her in a corner, content to be petted or waiting for us to pose her for photos. She's too well-behaved.

This time when I went back to Beijing, I happily went to Noy's house to pet cats. Their cat is called "Tietie", a very small and cute Russian Blue. She's also very well-behaved and kept playing with the data cable I brought.

A week of happily cuddling cats!!!

The main reason for this trip to Beijing was to attend the Gopher China 2023 conference. I've been in GoCN for two years now, and it was the first time meeting some team members and Asta Xie in person. During the event, I had a great chat about Serverless and GPT with a guy at an outdoor tent booth. Just as we were about to add each other on WeChat, we realized he was my Twitter friend "Carson Yang (MichelangeloYang)". We had even had some small exchanges on Telegram before. Indeed, Twitter friends are all big shots.

Although time was a bit rushed, I had a delicious buffet lunch with Homura at noon. We had a great chat!

![candle_music](https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/candle_music.jpg)

The rest of the time was mostly spent with senior Boyi showing me around. Because it was quite casual, I didn't take many photos. I did record a candlelight concert that left a deep impression on me. It had a great atmosphere.

![aniya_toy_from_boyi](https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/aniya_toy_from_boyi.jpg)

And amazingly, senior Boyi has a superpower. She can always get what she wants from gashapon machines. I didn't believe it before, but she got the Anya I wanted on the first try (and then I kept happily clutching Anya's capsule toy, I think even the shop owner was amused).
