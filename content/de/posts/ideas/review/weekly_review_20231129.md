## Preface

This piece is a record and reflection of my life from `2023-11-22` to `2023-11-29`.

This week, my senior and I were both confined at home recovering from influenza A, which significantly impacted our work and daily life. I finished recording the podcast I mentioned last time, chatting casually for over an hour. Despite running a fever for two days over the weekend, I struggled to go out on Sunday to attend Lawrence's offline event. After the fever subsided, I went to the hospital for a check-up just to be safe. There was nothing serious, but I still need to wait for a full recovery. Many interesting things happened as well.

## Lawrence the Deer

A long time ago, I streamlined my input sources and reduced the time spent on various media platforms, cutting down my follows to less than 100. However, Bilibili remains an app I open daily, with "[Lawrence the Deer](https://space.bilibili.com/37029661)" being the primary reason.

I started following him about three or four years ago. Back then, Lawrence often traveled in search of himself, leaving behind many memories in Japan. Perhaps it was due to some similar scenes, or his lonely yet intense love for this world, I always felt his lens and narration had a beauty reminiscent of Hirokazu Koreeda. Later, in a Q&A session, I heard that his favorite director is also Hirokazu Koreeda. Indeed.

Later, he met Ms. Mi.

I watch each of their videos as soon as they're released. I've seen Ms. Mi's figure gradually appear in his lens, stories about him and his cat, dialogues with his ten-year-ago self, the ritual of year-end summaries, up until the recent proposal. It's hard for me to describe what kind of beauty exists between them. They both have their own lives and pursuits, progressing on their own trajectories, yet mutually attracted, rescuing each other, pulling each other out of loneliness.

At that time, I was also seeking my own path - "[A 23-year-old's Confession: In Pursuit of Meaning](https://www.pseudoyu.com/en/2020/06/06/yearly_review_23/)". Confused, at a loss, yet stubbornly pursuing the meaning of life itself. Later, I also experienced studying abroad for what I wanted to do, the pain of losing loved ones, the confusion of life changes, and so on. When I felt overwhelmed with sadness, I would repeatedly watch Lawrence's videos, finding that I could always find empathy in his narratives, which gave me strength. Later, I started keeping cats, recording these life moments through writing, saying some words to myself in year-end summaries, and capturing some life fragments with a camera after regaining the courage to live. Later, I often received feedback from readers who found resonance or drew strength from my writings. Suddenly, I realized this might also be a kind of passing on the torch, transmitting the encouragement I received to more people.

This time, I was fortunate enough to get a ticket to Lawrence's sharing session at "Today At Apple". He talked a lot about his creation and life itself. I was familiar with all the memes and video details he mentioned, and that's when I realized that this had become a part of my life.

He mentioned that [the next video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Gc411z7mu) would also be tearful yet joyous, and he used a muting technique similar to Oppenheimer. Little did I expect it to be a proposal!!! Congratulations!!!

## Snapshots of This Week

Indeed, I feel my physical condition has declined this year. In April, I had a rather severe acute gastroenteritis, and in May, I tested positive for COVID for the first time (though I recovered in two days). This week, I caught influenza A and had a fever for a few days, with considerable aftereffects still lingering. It's truly uncomfortable. I need to pay more attention to keeping warm in autumn and winter. Plans are falling behind more and more, which is troublesome.

Also, because I've been cooped up at home for too long, I haven't done much extra, nor had much energy to cook. I hope everything gets back on track soon. This weekend, I'll go back to Hangzhou for a while first. I'll be able to see some colleagues and go to the long-missed "Crazy Thursday" at Liangzhu.

## Interesting Things and Objects

### Input

Although most interesting inputs are automatically synced in the "Yu's Life" Telegram channel, I'll still select some to list here. It feels more like a newsletter now.

#### Books

- [Up At the Villa](https://book.douban.com/subject/6764127/), a small book, sort of a "mystery novel" without much plot, with more dialogue and psychological descriptions, yet still quite engaging to read in one sitting. It tells a story of "desperate love". A young violinist regains hope for life due to Mary's "love" bestowed upon him, only to have it quickly shattered, leading to suicide; Edgar only loves the pure and flawless Mary in his memory and imagination; Rowley is a wealthy playboy, yet loves most purely, passionately, and recklessly; Mary is conflicted, clearly knowing her own heart, wavering due to wealth and status, yet insisting on confessing everything that happened to her completely before accepting Edgar's love. Behind love, there's quite a bit of utilitarianism, self-righteousness, and self-satisfaction. Perhaps only by screening these out can one truly feel the purity of love itself.
- [Neurosis and Human Growth](https://book.douban.com/subject/26774193/), recommended by homura, reading a bit every night.
