## Preface

This piece is a record and reflection of my life from `2023-03-25` to `2023-04-02`.

Never did I imagine that as a southerner who lived in Hangzhou for over a decade, I would suffer severe adaptation issues upon returning to live in Hangzhou.

In the previous post, I mentioned that Nini was a bit sick due to the bumpy journey and other factors. Fortunately, after a period of adjustment, we went for a detailed check-up yesterday, and there are no issues anymore. Some nutritional supplements were prescribed for recuperation.

However, in the first week of settling in after moving and handling various settlement matters, my body started showing various reactions. Since I'm the type who rarely falls ill, I didn't pay much attention. When I finally relaxed, everything erupted at once.

Other than that, I'm adapting to the new work mode and rhythm. Due to physical and mental fatigue, I didn't leave myself much buffer time, so my state in work and other arrangements hasn't been ideal. However, I'm in the process of self-adjustment.

One more sentimental note:

## Illness

After leaving the boarding school life in high school, my increasingly irregular sleep and eating habits led me to have a both casual and somewhat fearful attitude towards health. During the busiest and most multi-threaded time in college, I even had the strange idea that "as long as I don't know my physical condition, I can continue to push myself with peace of mind." Therefore, I didn't have a physical examination for a long time.

It wasn't until I took some time off at home that I started paying attention to it, getting a physical examination, taking care of dental issues, and addressing various big and small problems. Since then, I've been somewhat more careful with my health. Interestingly, I've always been the type to push my body but miraculously remain relatively healthy. Despite spending over ten hours a day staring at a computer screen, my eyesight hasn't deteriorated much. Without taking many precautions, I've dodged several waves of the pandemic and remained uninfected. This led to a false impression that I might not get sick.

Perhaps it was due to the intense social dining of the previous two weeks, or drinking with friends for two consecutive days on the first weekend back, or maybe drinking a glass of cold fresh milk late at night for some reason. I started feeling some gastrointestinal discomfort on Monday but didn't pay much attention to it. I neither went to the hospital nor took any medication, just endured it for two days. Finally, on Wednesday and Thursday, I faced the consequences. By the afternoon, I was in so much pain that I had to lie down curled up in a ball for slight relief. My habit of staying up late, waking up early, and not napping was forcibly corrected to a healthy schedule (it didn't hurt when I was asleep). I finally obediently ordered some medicine and started taking it on Thursday. It only began to improve slightly the next day. It wasn't until I went for a check-up today that I learned it was probably acute gastroenteritis, which I had dragged out until all indicators were normal.

Although I didn't have to take sick leave in my first week of work, apart from completing some basic, not-too-difficult work tasks, I made no extra progress in other areas this week. I even felt a bit embarrassed to write this weekly review. It's only now, as I'm nearing recovery, that I truly feel how good health is. I'll be sure to have regular check-ups and take care of my body in the future, as it greatly affects various aspects of life.

## Work

At work, since I was already familiar with some of the people and project situations, it was more about exploring on my own based on existing materials and code. I also familiarized myself with the development process through one or two small requirements. Going forward, I'll be able to choose interesting requirements to develop, which is a nice approach.

However, my planned schedule of thoroughly reading code and getting familiar with a new module was disrupted by my illness. Overall, I'm not too satisfied, feeling like I haven't quite returned to the state of focused coding. Fortunately, I've almost fully recovered by the weekend, so I'll need to catch up more next week.

Perhaps due to my previous remote work experience, I adapted quickly to the remote work mode. It's not a new experience, but I need to refine my task management system further.

## Nini's Recent Situation

In the previous post, I mentioned that Nini was sick. After two weeks of treatment, she has finally recovered. To be sure, we still took her to a nearby veterinary hospital for a complete check-up. Everything is fine, and her spirit and appetite have returned to normal.

At first, Nini was a bit reserved and gloomy in the new home.

After getting familiar with the environment, she seems even more relaxed than when we were in Beijing. Now she even sleeps directly on my shoulder all night or lies on the blanket next to me. I feel she's adapted faster than I imagined, completing the transition from a northern cat to a southern kitty.

Until...

A friend, who is going on a long trip soon, brought their kitten to my house to familiarize with the environment and for us to take care of. This way, even when I'm out, my family can help feed and clean up. I originally thought Nini would be very happy to have a playmate, but for some reason, they don't get along. The two cats are always intimidating each other, quarreling, and even fighting when they're together. This has been going on for two days.

At first, Nini, as the owner of the house, seemed to cower and lose her territory, often hiding in corners or lying quietly. But for some reason, starting tonight, they both started to attack each other, and they've been fighting until now.

Currently, both owners are emotionally unmoved and even watching and betting on the fight. Actually, it's mainly because they haven't landed a single hit on each other even after fighting for so long, it's all just bluffing attacks. My inner thoughts are as follows:

I'll report on the new battle situation next week, or hopefully, they'll wake up as best friends.

## New Journey and Plans

![meet_with_xiao](https://image.pseudoyu.com/images/meet_with_xiao.png)

This weekend, I met a new friend, [Xiao](https://twitter.com/gxgexiao), in Hangzhou. We had read each other's blogs before but never met in person, so we arranged a meal together. We talked about many things, from technology to life, from work to life philosophy, from ideals to reality, from emotions to freedom. It was quite amazing.

Another friend mentioned earlier that they want to make an effort to meet more interesting people this month. Having been introverted for many years, I've only recently realized the charm of this. Communicating with people of different experiences often brings new perspectives and ideas. Perhaps this is the value of seeking common ground while reserving differences.

So starting this month, I also plan to go out more and meet more interesting people. It's part of my plans for this new phase. However, I still need to balance the time with remote work, which I'm still trying to figure out.

Over the next month, I'll be in Wuhan, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Hong Kong, Chengdu, and Xi'an in succession. The schedule is packed but I'm full of anticipation. If you're interested, we might meet by chance.
