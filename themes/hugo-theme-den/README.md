## Installation

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/shaform/hugo-theme-den themes/den
```

**Important:** Take a look inside the [`exampleSite`](https://github.com/shaform/hugo-theme-den/tree/master/exampleSite) directory of this theme.
You'll find a file called [`config.toml`](https://github.com/shaform/hugo-theme-den/blob/master/exampleSite/config.toml).
**To use it, copy the [`config.toml`](https://github.com/shaform/hugo-theme-den/blob/master/exampleSite/config.toml) in the root directory of your Hugo site.**
You can customize it for your site.

## Language Support

> Translations are collected from the [`themes/den/i18n/`](https://github.com/shaform/hugo-theme-den/tree/master/i18n) directory (built into the theme), as well as translations present in `i18n/` at the root of your project. The translations will be merged and take precedence over what is in the theme folder.

Set the default language using `defaultContentLanguage`:
```toml
defaultContentLanguage = "en"  # en / zh-tw / other...
```

## Update Theme

```bash
cd ./themes/den/
git pull
```
